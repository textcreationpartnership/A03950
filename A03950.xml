         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <q>When the vncleane ſpirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, ſeeking rest. And when he findeth none, hee ſaith, I will returne vnto mine houſe whence J cam out.

               </epigraph>
               <p>IN this Parable theſe 3. principall conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations are to be obſerued. Firſt, that all of vs (by nature) are ſubiect to the temptations of the deuill, to his often &amp; manifold temptations, who preuaileth in ſome, more then in other ſome. Adam was tempted, &amp; hee fell; and the wicked conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually yeeld to his temptations, &amp; are ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come.
<pb facs="tcp:20355:13"/>Chriſt was tempted, and he reſiſted, and vanquiſhed him, and in him and by his power, all the godly are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>querers ouer the deuil, &amp; his wicked &amp; ouerthrowing temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. Secondly, there is a time when the deuil goeth out of vs, either by Gods grace, or good counſel, or true &amp; vnfained repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. He goeth not out willingly &amp; of him ſelfe, but he is throwne &amp; thruſt out.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, his woful return in them, that do not endeuour to keepe him out, becauſe their eſtate ſhalbe far worſe, and they ſhall hardly or neuer be cured and recouered. Our maiſterful ſin, wherunto we are giuen, more then to any of the reſt, is neuer alone, but is accompanied with many other. And when the deuill entreth againe, he brings in with him; nay, a legion folow after him, for he comes with power enough, &amp; thinks it vnpoſſible that hee ſhould be reſiſted, or if he be reſiſted, he wil not ſo be vanquiſhed, neither wil he euer giue vs vp, ſo long as we are compaſſed with this mortall and ſinfull body of ours. Rom. 7.24. Heb. 12.1.</p>
               <p>Some think this parable was vttred to the wicked Scribes and Phariſes, and the rather through the prouocation of their blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous ſpeech, againſt their own conſcience,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:20355:13"/>which ſaid, that he caſt out deuils by Belze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bub. But it is more likely he ſpake it to the man, that was poſſeſſed with the deuill, out of whom the deuil was caſt out. Where it is moſt worthy of our meditation to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider, by whom he was caſt out, not as the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſuppoſe by Belzebub, but by one more mighty &amp; powerful then Belzebub, and all the deuils in hel. 1. Ioh. 3.8. For to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe appeared the ſon of god, that he might loſe the works of the deuil, which are ſinne, death, &amp; hel. Greatly to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort the godly in al diſtreſſes of body &amp; mind, while they are aſſured, not onely that through his help all deſperate diſeaſes are cured, but alſo that the malicious work of ſathan, is by his almighty power, vtterly deſtroied and ſcattered. Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vs ſufficient encouragement, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not to feare that hurt which ſathan may worke againſt vs, but alſo to haue recourſe to him in all our diſtreſſes, either of body or of minde, how dangerous ſoeuer they be, as alſo to giue him thanks &amp; praiſe, for his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold goodnes toward vs, &amp; being deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, to take heede, leaſt by our negligence, wee fall into the like dangers againe. As Chriſt gaue warning, to him that had been diſeaſed thirtie eyght yeeres, and nowe was
<pb facs="tcp:20355:14"/>healed, &amp; brought to his former ſtrength, by the vertue of his heauenly power and gracious goodnes: Iohn. 5. Behold, thou art made whole, ſin no more, leaſt a worſe thing come vnto thee.</p>
               <p>Chriſt put forth this parable, not ſo much to warne him, out of whom the deuill vvas caſt, as alſo in the behalfe of the company that was preſent, and the ſtanders by. Ioh. 12.30. To teach all the godly and the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters eſpecially, to haue great regard of theyr talke, that it may be powdered with ſalt, that it may tend to edifying, and may giue grace to the hearers. Coloſ. 4.6. For often-times the ſtanders by, do more mark, &amp; giue more diligent heed, to that vvhich is ſpoken, then the party to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſpeech is directed, &amp; to whom it doth moſt pertaine.</p>
               <p>The ſcope of this parable is principallie to ſhew, how heauy a iudgement they heap vpon themſelues, which refuſing the grace of God offered vnto them, doe lay open a paſſage for the deuil to enter in againe. For if through theyr want to heede-taking, they giue him entrance again, he wil moſt hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or neuer be driuen out. Therfore are we willed, to worke out our ſaluation vvith feare and trembling, Phil. 2.12. And to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:20355:14"/>reſiſt the deuill, that ſo he may flie from vs, Iames. 4.7. And let vs apply this parable to Chriſt his meaning, as if he had ſaid, I came to expell ſathan out of you, that I might raigne within you. And if you will not that I ſhould raigne in you, and ouer you, and that you deſpiſe my grace and goodnes, in this ſort ſhall you be puniſhed, that the euil ſpirit which was caſt out of you, ſhal return againe, and your ſtubbornnes ſhall thus be rewarded, that you ſhall altogether be blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and reſerued to moſt wofull deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>How ſubiect we are to the deuils malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous intents &amp; continuall temptations,<note place="margin">How ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the deuils temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</note> may appeare heerein, not onely by his hatred to the common ſort of man-kind, but euen to the beſt. And beholding his temptations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our Sauiour, we may not looke that we ſhould ſtand free. For if hee were bold to vex the head, he will not ſpare the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. He ſpared not our firſt parents in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radice, in the eſtate of their innocencie and integrity, how much leſſe will hee ſpare vs, which are compaſſed about with ſo great corruption &amp; ſin? If he was bold to tempt Dauid to adultery and murder, Aaron and Salomon to idolatry, Peter to periurie, and
<pb facs="tcp:20355:15"/>Saint Paule to the luſts of the fleſh. 2. Cor. 12.7.8.9. How ſhall wee thinke to eſcape, which are not ſtrengthned or endued with ſo great gifts &amp; graces? If hee had his force againſt lob, a righteous man, and one that feared God, God himſelfe ſo witneſſing of him, let vs make no other reckoning, but to prepare our ſelues to temptation. Hee is moſt buſie about vs, when wee are leaſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of his working. Hee is not onely dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to compaſſe the earth to and fro, but hee goeth about like a roaring Lyon, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king whom hee may deuoure. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no maruell, though we read. Reue. 12.12. a woe pronounced againſt the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the earth, becauſe the deuill beeing caſt out, is come downe vnto them, vvho hath great wrath, becauſe he knoweth hee hath but a ſhort time. Hee could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile in heauen, therefore he will ſhew all his force on the inhabitants of the earth. Whoſe wrath is great, &amp; therefore we muſt looke for no mercy at his hands, whoſe time is but ſhort, and therfore he wil loſe no op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, whereby he may draw vs to our deſtruction. And ſeeing his time it but ſhort, &amp; the battel not long, let vs frame our ſelues, the more valiantly to reſiſt him. And
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:20355:15"/>here is the comfort of the godly, that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples of Chriſt, ſaw ſathan fal downe from heauen like lightning. Lu. 10.18. For as the force of the lightning is ſuddaine &amp; ſoone gone, ſo the fierceſt aſſaults of the deuil, are but ſhort, to them that can through Gods grace endure and ouercome them. Again, this is another comfort, that though he be come down vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the earth, yet he is thrown out of heauen, and they whoſe eſpeciall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light is in heauenly meditations and godly exerciſes, are moſt free fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his wrath, though not altogether free from his temptations.</p>
               <p>This wo toucheth not the godly &amp; them that reſiſt his temptations, for from them he ſoone flieth. Iam. 4.7. but as for the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly he hath them in a ſnare, &amp; wo be to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that cannot auoid &amp; reſiſt him. 2. Tim. 2.26. Howbeit, they that are moſt godly, the deuil almeth at the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> moſt, eyther to bring them to ſhame, or to vtter ouerthrow. As Chriſt ſaid to Peter, giuing him a forewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, Lu. 22.31. Simon, Simon, behold ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than hath deſired to winow you as Wheat, but I haue prayed for thee, that thy fayth faile not. The corne that is winowed is ſif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the vtmoſt, ſo doth ſathan tempt &amp; try the godly, as far as poſſibly may be.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:20355:16"/>
               <p>Againe, the corne being winowed, doth ſhew it ſelfe in his excellency; ſo the godly beeing tryed and found ſtedfaſt, doe make Gods grace &amp; goodnes to appeare in them moſt glorious, to theyr great commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: neuertheleſſe, through their owne ſtrength, they cannot ſtand ſtedfaſt. 1. Cor. 10.12. To many theyr temptations are theyr crownes. Iam. 1. My brethren, count it exceeding ioy, when yee fall into diuers temptations. For hereby the woorthy ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of the godly are made manifeſt, which lay hid before.</p>
               <p>Sathan, to worke Ioſephs ouer-throwe, doth not only lay before him a moſt temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting baite, but ſifts him to the vtmoſt. For his lewde. Miſtreſſe, through the deuils temptations, beeing bewitched vvith his loue, dooth not vpon the firſt deniall leaue of her ſute, but aſſaieth him againe and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, vſing all meanes, and ſeeking all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions and opportunities, yet by Gods grace he with-ſtood them all. And though there-hence there aroſe his greateſt trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, yet God did deliuer him out of all, &amp; made his ſuppoſed ſhame, the greateſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of his future honour and renowne. The like may be ſaid of Suſanna.</p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:20355:16"/>
               <p>As the deuill ſhewed all his policie in tempting Chriſt, ſo is his craft and ſubtiltie more forcible toward the godlieſt, &amp; them that are beſt diſpoſed, becauſe they are ſom ſtay and hinderance vnto him, that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſo greatly preuaile in the worlde as hee would. For by theyr good counſaile, and good example, and godly behauiour, they winne many vnto God, and ſo doe greatlie croſſe and preuent the miſchieuous malice of the deuill; and becauſe this ſort of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, I meane the godly, are fartheſt out of his reach, ſo are the temptations which hee worketh againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> moſt mighty. Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the reſt of the world, in whom hee ruleth as he liſt, are eaſily carried away with ſhewes and ſhadowes.</p>
               <p>After he had tempted Chriſt, and could not preuaile, it is ſaid he left him for a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, purpoſing to returne again. So alſo dealeth hee with the godly, whom though hee cannot bring to the bent of his bow, though hee giue them reſpite for a vvhile, yet his mind is to ſet vpon them with freſh aſſaults. And many which haue good gifts and graces, he ouercommeth with eaſe and pleaſure, and idlenes, &amp; negligence, or elſe maketh them to abuſe theyr gifts, to badde
<pb facs="tcp:20355:17"/>ends and purpoſes. When we are idle, then is his fitteſt time to ouerthrow vs, nay, when wee are in godly exerciſes, hee ceaſeth not then to practiſe his feates. Bringing in wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering thoughts, either when we heare the Word, or be at our prayers, being careleſſe at the time, and forgetfull afterward. Hee maketh not onely the inſtruments of ſinne, that is, all vices; but euen the beſt gyfts, and godlieſt exerciſes, the meanes to ſerue his turne, and to worke his miſchiefe againſt vs.</p>
               <p>As for them which haue a greater regard, and are more wary, he entreth &amp; incloſeth within them by ſlie and ſecret meanes; as if they are bent to any good, to hinder them from it, by ſhewing vnto them many diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, lets, and hinderances, that the vvay to heauen is ſtraite &amp; narow, and as it were the climing vp of a ſandy hill, or high rock, and that the paſſage there-vnto, is full of dangers, and ful of troubles. Hee cauſeth many godly that are ſet in high roomes, to fall, and to giue offence, that thereby others might take a liberty to doe euill. Neyther doth hee refraine to inuegle the mindes of them that are ſet in higheſt degree, as the faireſt marks hee hath to ſhoote at, to make
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:20355:17"/>them ſwarue and goe aſtray. As if they be in place of iudgement, to giue falſe ſentence for gaine of golde; if they be ſet to reproue the ſinnes of the people, to ſtand in feare of mens diſpleaſure; if in ſtate of nobility and great poſſeſſions, to make theyr will a law, according to the Latine verſe.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Sic volo, ſic iubeo, ſtet pro ratione voluntas.</l>
               </q>
               <p>So I will, and ſo I commaund, and let my will ſtand for a reaſon, and for a lawe. But eſpecially, &amp; aboue the reſt, if they be prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, he tempteth and perſwadeth them, that all things are lawfull for them, that they are aboue theyr lawes, and are not to be cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by any man; whereby they perſwade vnto themſelues a liberty to ſinne, and who ſhould controule them, as was manifeſt in the Emperours of Rome.</p>
               <p>His ſleights are ſo deceitfull, as to ſhewe the brauerie, pleaſure, and profit of anie thing, where-vnto hee tempteth; but hee keepeth backe from vs the miſchiefes that accompanie the ſame; and ſo blindeth our eyes as it were in the noone day. The mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer he maketh beleeue, that reuenge is an eaſe to the hart, &amp; keepeth back that blood will require blood.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:20355:18"/>
               <p>Him that followeth the lewdnes of his fleſhly luſts, he tickleth him on in this, how pleaſant it is to continue &amp; wallow in ſuch ſinfull deſires, and keepeth backe the ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes &amp; diſeaſes, and other painful griefes, which may ſhorten his lyfe. Him that is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to theft and robbery, him hee perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth that hee may haue wealth at will, and liue as he liſt, and keepeth backe from him the horrour of a ſhamefull death, which he is not alwaies like to eſcape. Him that is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to ſlaunder his neighbour, what fauour and aduantage hee ſhall get by it, and kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth backe this fearefull ſentence, Who ſo priuily ſlaundereth his neighbour, him will I deſtroy.</p>
               <p>Thus he ſtealeth all inconueniences and hurtful after-claps out of our harts, that we might not ſee the ſnare that is lay de before vs, and the dangers that wee are like to fall. into. All occaſions hee watcheth, to allure and to prouoke vs, he commeth neere vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, and feeleth our affections and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and offreth matters to our ſences. If wee be giuen to drunkennes, he will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice vs by the pleaſantnes of the wine, and the ſweetneſse of the drinke; If vnto glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony, he will entice vs with plenty of meate
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:20355:18"/>and belly-cheere; If poſſeſſed by the luſtes of the fleſh, he will tempt vs with the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of women, who haue no care of theyr chaſtitie, and make ſmall account of theyr honeſtie and good name; If vnto anie of theſe, or the like motions and temptations, wee giue our conſent, then hath the deuill what he would, and ſo will hee vſe meanes to proceed f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rther, ſo will hee take aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage againſt vs, by watching and prying in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the corruption of our owne nature, and ſo becomming daily and continually our domeſticall foe.</p>
               <p>And although wee may keepe our ſelues in, neuer ſo warily, and reſtraine our ſelues, and haue an eye vnto our own inclinations, yet if we be too hard for him one way, hee will venture vpon vs another way, hee will neuer leaue, but ſtil be tempting of vs. And therefore our life is truely ſaid to be a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, that wee might alwaies ſtand in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines, to fight againſt theſe temptations, to be alwaies practiſed in auoiding that which is euill. When one temptation vvill not take place, our enemy tryeth another, as an inuincible fighter, that is ſtill prepared vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the combat. One temptation followeth in the necke of another, either in matters
<pb facs="tcp:20355:19"/>which concerne the body and outward af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres, or ſuch as pertaine to the ſpirit and minde of man, and to the eſtate of another life.</p>
               <p>Therefore, vvhen one temptation is paſt, and the trouble ended, we muſt not thinke to reſt vnmoleſted, as fleſh &amp; blood natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally perſwadeth it ſelfe, we muſt not be lul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the cradle of ſecurity, but we muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes prepare our ſelues to a newe &amp; freſh aſſault, to be ready to incounter with euery new temptation. And this is the cauſe why many are ouer-come by temptations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they promiſe peace and ſafetie vnto themſelues in this life, becauſe they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes vnprouided, and neuer looke for the worſt, neuer looke to preuent temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Beeing altogether ignorant of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils diligence, who is ready at all aſſaies, and looketh after euery occaſion.</p>
               <p>But wee in this matter are altogether as careleſſe as they that are recouered from ſome great and dangerous ſickneſſe, vvee thinke vvee ſhall not fall into the ſame, or the like againe. Howbeit we muſt knowe, that temptations are more rife with vs then ſickneſſes, and the dangers of the one, farre greater then the other.</p>

And aboue all other, his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary temptation is, by adultery, whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, vncleannes, and wantonneſſe: and therefore he is truly termed in this place, to be <hi>the vncleane Spirit.</hi> Hee is called an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane ſpirit, not onely becauſe he hath loſt his purity and his innocencie, wherein hee was firſt created, but alſo becauſe hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in all vncleanneſſe, &amp; is an vtter ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to all holines.</p>
               <p>Knowing well our inclination, and howe prone our corrupt nature &amp; fleſh &amp; blood is to this ſinne, he maketh vs to fight againſt our ſelues, while hee ſtandeth by to behold the conqueſt. According to that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle Saint Peter giueth vs warning of, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Deerely beloued, I beſeech you as ſtrangers and pilgrims, to abſtaine from fleſhly luſts, which fight againſt the ſoule.

By good counſell much is brought to paſſe, vvhich is the meanes which GOD vſeth to bring ſome into the way againe. Theyr owne conſcience alſo teſtifying vnto them, howe farre they goe aſtray, and mouing them to forſake the deuill and all his workes. But the cheefeſt meanes whereby he is throwne out, is the conuerting grace of God, which doth not onely miniſter good thoughts, &amp; good wiſhes, and good deſires, but giueth ſufficient effect and power thereunto, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vs able to throw out the deuill, and to reſiſt him. The effect of this grace is, that it prouoketh vs to true repentance, vvhich doth not conſiſt in the ſhedding of teares ſo much, as in the conuerſion of the hart, &amp; the amendement of our life and conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. All this notwithſtanding, how ſoeuer he be throwne out, like a male-content he
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:20355:20"/>neuer reſteth, but ſeekes to enter in againe, being ful loth, to be long without his Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and dwelling place.</p>
               <p>The force of Chriſt his redemption, doth principally work this exile and baniſhment of the deuill, &amp; his daily interceſſion in the behalfe of the godly, doth worke it more and more. Where by the way wee haue a notable inſtruction, to conſider how miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable the eſtate of mankinde is by nature, that he is the habitation &amp; reſting place of the deuill, and of the vncleane ſpirit. Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it true onely in this or that man, but in all the poſterity of Adam. And this is the glory &amp; renowne of our naturall or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther corrupt integrity, that both in body &amp; in ſoule the deuill raigneth in vs. By howe much the more therefore, haue we cauſe to extoll the vnſpeakable mercy of God, who of filthy and lothſome ſtables of the deuill, maketh vs temples to himſelfe, &amp; conſecrat places, for his holy ſpirit to reſt in. Only di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent carefulnes is heere required, that we continually remember, how great a benefit we haue receaued, in that we are freed from ſo troubleſome a gueſt, and ſo deadly an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie. And now haue we time to conſider Gods goodnes, &amp; to continue therein, and
<pb facs="tcp:20355:21"/>to behold the great dangers we were in, and to learne to auoide them, and to deteſt the deuils malice and miſchieuous working, &amp; to make a vow with our ſelues, not to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome and ruled by him.</p>
               <p>By good counſell hee may be throwne out, and yet no ſufficient diſcharge, but as he will thruſt in againe, ſo will he eaſily be admitted. Some doe vtterly refuſe good counſaile, and cannot abide to heare it, and hate them that bring it &amp; ſhew their good will herein. And they that ſhew themſelues tractable, for a while, may giue conſent, and alſo haue a purpoſe to order themſelues there-after, and yet the deuill can alter all, and make them ſtoope againe; and they that were at defiance, are ready nowe to ſhake hands, and to make a new couenant, vvhat friend and faythfull counſailour ſo euer ſpeake againſt it. The guilt of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, the ſight and knowledge of his ſin, the feare of Gods diſpleaſure, and danger of hell torments, is enough to make vs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweare the deuill, and to hate his allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and to deſire godly company and counſell, the deuill lets vs alone, ſo long as we are in this minde, he hopes wee will not long coutinue in this vaine, his time hee
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:20355:21"/>will watch, when he knowes how to take vs tardy, and then the Caſtell is wone againe, and a ſtronger garriſon ſet to keepe it. The grace of God is the canon ſhot, that breaks downe the walls. When a ſtrong man ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med keepeth the breach and the paſſage, for a while he poſſeſſeth and keepeth all in peace: But when a ſtronger then he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth vpon him, and ouer commeth him, hee muſt be faine to giue place. And this is a greater comfort, that his armour ſhall be taken away from him, and the ſpoiles ſhall be deuided. For Chriſt in his croſſe and paſſion ouercame the power of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil for vs. Coloſſ. 2.15. He hath ſpoiled the principalities and powers, and hath made a ſhew of them openly, and hath tryumplied ouer them in the ſame croſſe, and made a glorious conqueſt. And not onely ſo, but alſo hauing led captiuity captiue, hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen gifts vnto men, that being ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by his grace, they alſo ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours through the vertue of his power. And this is the glorious and tryumphant gyft of Gods grace, in vvhom vvhile it vouchſafeth to enter as a conquerour, it bringeth vvith it many good compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ioyfull effectes. 2. Corinthi. 7.
<pb facs="tcp:20355:22"/>For godly ſorrowe is one of the attenders, which cauſeth repentance vnto ſaluation. And behold what godly ſorrow worketh, what great care followeth, to ſerue God, to liue in his feare, to auoid our former ſinns; what clearing of our ſelues in acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging our faults, &amp; asking God forgiuenes, and deſiring to be renued in mind, and that God would create a new hart in vs. Pſ. 51.

               <p>Now although he be thus valiantly reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, yet is hee not throughly vanquiſhed, nor vtterly baniſhed, though his force and power againſt vs is broken, yet his euill will remaines, and he wil let paſſe no deuice, but puts dangerous matters ſtill in practiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs, and we ſhal not be free from him, ſo long as we liue in this world. Therefore it behooueth vs to looke vnto our ſelues, &amp;

And this is his chiefeſt delight, and his chiefeſt ſtudy, his only practiſe and trade, wherein he is moſt diligent, though he haue no thankes for his paines. All his endeuours tend to mans de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and eſpecially where he is driuen away by the force of Chriſt his grace and power, the more is his deſire to hurt, the more is his rage. And before we are vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed of this heauenly helpe, our mortall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie makes but a ſport to raigne within vs at his pleaſure, but being driuen out of vs, he takes great griefe thereat; hauing thus loſt his booty and his pray, he gathers new ſtrength, and ſtirreth vp all his ſences and wits a-freſh, to ſet vpon vs, and to aſſault vs. Therefore is he ſaid to walke through dry places, becauſe his baniſhment out of vs, is to him, as a deſolate and moſt vncomforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wildernes. Being caſt out of man, he is
<pb facs="tcp:20355:23"/>ſaid to ſeeke reſt, becauſe he is then moſt vexed, and moſt at diſquiet within himſelf, ſeeking by all meanes poſſible, to recouer that which he hath loſt. Heere then we are to learne that as ſoone as we are called by Chriſt his grace, that we are to looke for mighty temptations and heauy aſſaults, for the deuill will not ſo eaſily looſe his pray, as alſo we are with all circumſpection &amp; wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines, to ſet our ſelues againſt him, &amp; to vſe all means to preuent his power, for his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred is moſt deadly, and his fury &amp; rage not ouercom by a little. Howbeit, this forewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, ought not to breede any feare within our minds, or any whit to diſcourage vs, but rather to fore-ſhew vs what danger may fall vpon vs, through our owne negligence.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The third waighty conſideration in this parable, is the woful return of the vncleane ſpirit, in them that are not watchfull, &amp; doe not their beſt endeuour to keepe him out, when they are once free from his thraldom and ſlauery.</p>
               <p>And when he findeth none, he ſaith,<note place="margin">His wofull returne.</note> I wil return vnto mine houſe, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce I cam out.] Wherin theſe circumſtances may be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. Firſt our negligence &amp; ſinfull &amp; eaſie back-ſliding. And when he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth, he fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it empty ſwept &amp; garniſhed. Secondly his cruelty in returning, in that he bringeth with him 7. other ſpirits, worſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> himſelf. Thirdly, the wofull eſtate of that man or
<pb facs="tcp:20355:24"/>woman, who forgetting God and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, haue yeelded themſelues captiues to the deuils ſlauery. They enter in &amp; dwel there. So the laſt ſtate of that man is worſe then the firſt. In which wofull caſe, for are-ſtoratiue this may be added, that no man or woman deſpaire, if they be not vtterly paſt grace, though they fall againe, ſeeing there is a difference betwixt a reſolute determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in ſin, &amp; a repentant mind, which is hartily ſorry for euery fall and offence.</p>
               <p>I will returne.] He ſaith not, I will ſeeke to returne, or I will doe my beſt endeuour to returne, but I will returne, as though no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhould reſiſt him, and no power were able to vanquiſh and ouercome him. So cunning he is, that he hath his turnes &amp; his returnes, his termes &amp; his vacations, and he will come againe, although hee goe into a far Country, he is with vs before we are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware. When hee tolde Chriſt that all the Kingdoms of the earth were his to giue, yet it was nothing ſo, &amp; likewiſe where he ſaith he wil returne, he is oft-times hindered, that hee cannot doe as he would, but few there be that keepe him out, and too many that through theyr negligence, giue him too ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie an entrance.</p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:20355:24"/>
               <p>Vnto my houſe whence I cam out.] Firſt he commeth to the houſe, before he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize to come in. Firſt he viewes the ſtate of the man or woman, whether he or ſhee be returned to their old ſinnes againe. And as houſes be the habitations of men, ſo men themſelues be often the deuils houſes, for this is ſpoken by ſimilitude and compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
               <p>But why ſhould the deuill call the ſoule of man or woman, his owne houſe, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hee ſhould ſay, I will enter into that houſe from whence I came. The ſoule of man &amp; woman by creation, is Gods image, but the image of the deuill is the deforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all; he vſurpes the poſſeſſion of the ſoule of man, it is none of his by right. 1. Cor. 6.20. For the ſoule &amp; the body is the temple of God, and of his good ſpirit by right. 1. Cor. 6.13.15.19. How then haue we by ſinne, and the deuill by his temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, made them dennes for theeues, &amp; Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges for vncleane foules. If a Gentlewoman of high eſtate, ſhould match with a vile &amp; abiect ſlaue, although it did nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne vs, would it not greeue any of vs to ſee it? ſo is the eſtate of thy ſoule, ſubiect to the ſlauery of the deuill. Or if a man had
<pb facs="tcp:20355:25"/>maried a rich beautifull &amp; noble gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, adorned with all gifts &amp; graces, which may be deuiſed to be in a woman: and yet notwithſtanding ſhould ſo be ſotted, &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled with the loue of ſome foule &amp; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt begger, or ſeruile maid of his houſe, as for her ſake to abandon the company &amp; frendſhip of the ſaid wife; to ſpend his time in daliance &amp; ſeruice of his baſe woman, to run, to goe, to ſtand at her appointment: to put all his liuing &amp; reuenues into her hand, for her to conſume &amp; ſpoile at her pleaſure, to deny her nothing, but to waite and ſerue her at a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And ſurely the ſeruitude of our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſins, &amp; the returne of our former euill life, is far more ſlauiſh and intollerable. For no woman, yea no creature in the world, is, or can be of that beauty or nobility, as the grace of Gods ſpirit is, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> man by his creation was eſpouſed, &amp; to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his wicked life, &amp; by repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tance he had yeelded himſelf, which notwithſtanding af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a while we ſee abandoned, contemned, and reiected, as though there had beene no ſuch couenant made, and all for the loue of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:20355:25"/>ſenſuality, and his former wicked delights, where-with he is bewitched, which are vtter enemies to the grace of God, and as a moſt deformed creature in reſpect of reaſon. In whoſe loue notwithſtanding, or rather ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitude &amp; ſenceleſſe bondage, we ſee many ſo ouertaken &amp; drowned, as that they ſerue their ſenſuality day &amp; night, with all paines, perils, and expences, and doe conſtraine al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, euen the good motions of Gods ſpirit, to giue place at euery beck &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement, of this new miſtres, or rather ſtepdame.</p>
               <p>It is a greeuous euill, to be nouriſhed, and to grow vp, &amp; to be nuſled in ſinne. The child that is borne &amp; bred vp in a dark pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, maketh the ſame reckning of darknes, as other doe of light; they that are borne ſlaues, &amp; are vſed there-vnto, make little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of liberty; and they that know little of heauenly &amp; eternal matters, embrace the delights of the world, &amp; the filthines of ſin, vain &amp; tranſitory things, for tru &amp; precious bleſſings, which endure for euer, counting a baniſhed land as welcome to them, as their owne country. So many of the Iewes being bred &amp; brought vp in the bondage of Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gipt, did not once ſo much as thinke of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. And out of ſuch manner of people,
<pb facs="tcp:20355:26"/>wholy giuen vp to ſinne, when the deuill once entred he neuer went out. But when the good ſpirit of God hath diſpoſſeſſed him, and caſt him out, by hearing the word preached, and by cauſing vs to harken and to obey good counſell, and good exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then he may ſay, I will returne into my houſe from whence I came, if ſo be that I may find it ready for my turne, &amp; that vpon new remembrance I may claime new ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance. And behold a ſhame it is to ſay it, and a ſorrow it is to think of it, he fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the houſe ſwept &amp; garniſhed fit and ready prepared for him.<note place="margin">Swept.</note> For a ſinfull ſoule is a ſwept houſe to him; and whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the good ſpirit is baniſhed, and ſo honourable a gueſt hath very ſlender &amp; alſo vnreuerent enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, the deuill entreth againe as into his owne poſſeſſion, and claimes that houſe to be his owne by lawe, which he hath ſo good euidence to ſhew for. The neglect of Gods grace, is the deuils chiefe delight, and they that are deſtitute of Gods ſpirit, are fit to receaue the deuil. As for the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and the faithfull, which are foundly and plentifully endued with Gods grace &amp; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpirit, they are ſo well fenced and proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that the deuil can finde no hole, or the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:20355:26"/>leaſt chink to enter in at. The houſe ſwept and garniſhed, is a ſimilitude drawne from the vſe and cuſtome of men, whoſe chiefeſt delight is to haue all things handſome and neat, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are to entertain their friends. But vnto the deuil it is nothing ſo, for beaſt-lines is the beauty and trimmed houſe that he delights in, &amp; nothing pleaſeth him but filthines, the lewd liuer, the drunken toſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pot, that ſmels all of drink, the abhominable ſwearer, and bawdy talker, thoſe are houſes for him, and as a princely pallace. When we haue bid farwell to God and godlines, then are we fitte for him, and thoſe be his roomes of choyce, when through the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of Gods grace, all good qualities are baniſhed, and when we are thus baniſhed from our ſelues. Wee prepare our houſe for God, by faith and repentance; contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe prouiſion is made for the deuil, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n we think not of Gods iudgments, &amp; when the feare of God is choked and ſmothered vp within vs. Da. 13.9.</p>
               <p>When he findeth a man or woman pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted in ſinne, and defiled againe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing in their former ſinnes, whereof they haue repented, this is the houſe which is ſwept, and prepared for his comming, and
<pb facs="tcp:20355:27"/>in ſuch ſort as he wold wiſh to giue him en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment. It is not cleanlines, or hanſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, or ſweeping, or garniſhing, where-with the deuil is delighted; the reaſon is, becauſe he is an vnclean ſpirit, &amp; his delight is in vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanenes, &amp; thoſe men &amp; women that are moſt vncleane, they are the onely hoaſts to entertain ſo loathſom &amp; ſo homely a gueſt. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the houſe is ſwept from all cleanenes, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all godlines, honeſty, &amp; vertue, then is it ſwept as it ſhold be for him. This ſweeping is wel expreſſed in the Scripture, by two ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militudes; the firſt is, as when the Sow after waſhing hath walowed in mire, &amp; is all dir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, then is ſhe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared vnto that clean ſoule, which the deuil maketh choiſe of; the other ſimilitude is, of the dogg that is returned to his owne vomit. 2. Pet. 2.2.2.</p>
               <p>Sweeping is not enough, paring with an iron inſtrument is more needfull. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer cuſtome of ſinne, ſticks hard in thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, and a ſimple &amp; bare confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thy accuſtomed ſinne, which may be compared vnto a ſlight ſweeping, is not of that force, but that thy old cuſtom wil bring in the deuill againe, and giue thy old Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord his induction, into his new poſſeſſion. Thou hadſt need therefore to pare it away
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:20355:27"/>with great ſorrow &amp; harty repentance, ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning therto all diligence &amp; watchfulnes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſame, &amp; eſpecially and aboue the reſt, crauing Gods helpe &amp; aſſiſtance, that thou maiſt ouercome thy old euill cuſtom. But deceaue not thy ſelf in thy negligence, when thou doeſt theſe things for a ſhewe &amp; faſhion, confeſſing thy ſinns in ſuch ſort as though thou hadſt ſome other buſines in hand, and in the meane time as one that is careleſſe, thou liueſt content without feare, laying thy head vpon thy pillow. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to paſſe, that the deuill being as it were inuited into the houſe of thy ſoule, through thy euil cuſtom, maketh haſt and looketh not for a ſecond bidding. See therefore that thou pluck vp thy euil weeds by the roote, &amp; leaue no ſhew of the roote therof, in the ground of thy hart, if it be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, leaſt it take ſap &amp; ſtrength &amp; grow vp again. And that thou mayſt the better doe this, practiſe that vertue which is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to thy vice, which hath ſo mightily entangled thee, as ſobriety in ſteed of drukennes, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity in ſteede of whoredome, humility in ſteede of pride, loue and charity in ſteede of ſlaunder and euill report, liberality in ſteed of vſury, oppreſſion, and extortion,
<pb facs="tcp:20355:28"/>and ſo in the like, giuing heede there-vnto with all painfulnes, circumſpection, and watchfulnes. For as the Aethiopian cannot change his skin, nor the Leopard his ſpots, ſo ſome are wholy giuen to ſinne, and can neuer returne, becauſe they will not. Hee that is vſed to wholſom meat, cannot brook that which is vnſauory; and the ſouldiour that is accuſtomed to eate horſe-fleſh, after a while can away with it well enough. So before we are giuen to a cuſtome of ſinne, it ſeemeth vgly and loathſome, but when once we are caught in the ſnare, &amp; haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen our ſelues there-vnto, and haue had a pleaſant taſt therof, then we drink it down, as though it were ſweete vvine, and being once thus wedded, we are neuer purpoſed to be diuorced and to breake off. Come counſell, come threatnings, come perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, come puniſhments, afflictions, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of God, the ſhame of the world, a guilty conſcience, the feare of death and of hell, all is one. Iron twice hardned, muſt needes be moſt durable. Wee are like the deafe Adder, which ſtoppeth her eares, and we will not be called, or if we be called, we will not be vvone, charme the charmer ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo vviſely. The ſinner vvhen he is fallen
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:20355:28"/>into the depth of ſinne, then hee deſpiſeth all warnings, and ſetteth very light by his beſt friendes. They regard not the grace of God, but receiue it in vaine, and take as great delight in theyr ſinnes as if they were poſſeſſed of heauen, and with the ſow, they altogether delight to wallow in the mire.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is ſayd, that hee founde the houſe from whence he came,<note place="margin">Emptie:</note> empty. Mat. 12.44. After we haue repented, we becom idle, and lie open, euen as open as Noah, &amp; as careleſſe as Lot. Giue no place to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, Eph. 4. The idle giue roome enough, but they that are exerciſed in godly ſtudies and labours, the deuill hath no place there. The children of Dan tooke Lais, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple being careleſſe. Dauid was inticed to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery, beeing idle. Many ſeeme to labour, and to be buſied in a thouſand matters, as though they had not ſo much leyſure as to eate theyr meate, and yet theyr time is but idely ſpent, becauſe it is onely in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres of this life, and not concerning that which is to come; all for the body, and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or nothing for the ſoule. Luke. 10.42. Little children in making theyr toyes are meruailous buſie, and we in theſe worldlie matters are too forward, and all to little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
<pb facs="tcp:20355:29"/>becauſe the care of heauenly things is ſo much forgotten, or at leaſt-wiſe ſo ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly regarded: beeing meruailous wiſe in our owne conceit, while we vnderſtand no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. God would haue the people of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell to gather Manna, not to laſt a weeke, or a yeere, but for euery day. So muſt we caſt of ſloth, &amp; labour continually in the works of our vocation, vntil the ſabboth of reſt &amp; of glory come, ſo greatly deſired of vs, where then moſt happily, we ſhal enioy the fruite of all our labours. Reuel. 14.13. and this eſpecially, that by our painfull labours, in all godly ſort, we haue beene kept from committing great &amp; many offences, which otherwiſe we thight haue falne into, beeing preſerued by Gods grace, and made able to liue in his feare, and in his ſeruice.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, he findeth it garniſhed.] A bed orderly made, doth inuite vs to lye downe, &amp; a faire &amp; hanſome houſe, doth prouoke vs to come in, and beeing entred, there to make our ſtay and abode. The garniſhing of the houſe is but an accidental ornament, and the occaſions of ſinne, are great intice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments there-vnto. Therefore the Apoſtle willeth vs not onely to refraine from ſinne, but euen to abſtaine from all appearance of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:20355:29"/>euil. 1. Theſ. 5.22. Moſes would not leaue a hoofe behind him.<note place="margin">Occaſions of ſin muſt be auoided.</note> Exo. 10. and wee muſt auoyd euery little occaſion: for the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſin, are the ornaments of the houſe wherein the deuill delighteth to dwell, the occaſions of ſinne, are the deuils pledges, whereby hee hath an intereſt in vs. If thou haſt repented thee of thy whoredome, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine not thy whore, nor any iewell or to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of hers, whereby thy minde may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled to come into the remembrance of her loue: for that is the deuils hooke and ſnare, whereby he mindeth to catch and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trap thee, and to lay ſure hold on thee. The whore keepeth thy tokens, and preſenteth them to thine eyes, to drawe thee into her loue againe. Leuit. 8. Not onely the fleſh of the heiffer, but his skin and entrailes, were caſt out into an vncleane place. Deut. 7. God co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded his people to ouerthrow the Altars of the Cananites, to breake theyr Images, to cut down their groues, to burne all the ornaments of theyr Idols, that there might no token of idolatry, nor any reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance be left. Iehu tooke order, that all Bals prieſts, euery mother ſonne ſhould be ſlaine. Exo. 33. Moſes made the people to drink vp the aſhes of their golden Calfe.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:20355:30"/>
               <p>Many retaine the loue of the world, and the reliques of ſinne, and are very loath, nay they wil not leaue them at all; theyr aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent euill cuſtome remaines, wherby it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to paſſe, that miſerably they fall, into the manifold inconueniences &amp; great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of their former ſinnes. Hee that flyeth not occaſions, cannot auoyd ſinne, and hee that loueth danger, ſhall perriſh therein. This is that which our Sauiour Chriſt war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth. Mat, 18.9. It is better to enter into the kingdome of heauen halt &amp; lame, then ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing two hands, or two feete, to be ſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hell fire. God commaunded King Saul to deſtroy Amalec, and to ſpare no liuing creature that was in his land, but hee ſaued Agag the king of the Amalekites aliue, &amp; ſpared the Oxen and ſheepe aliue, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was hee caſt out of his kingdome, and came to a miſerable end. 1. Sam. 15. Why did God commaund the oxen and ſheepe to be ſlaine? they were harmleſſe creatures. The reaſon is, becauſe they were the goods of thoſe that were euill, and ſerued for their vſe. So muſt we kill &amp; extinguiſh not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſin, but the occaſions of ſinne, that ſerue therevnto, and that draw vs to the ſame, &amp; by freſh rem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>brance prouoke vs to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:20355:30"/>thereof. King Dauid prayed god that he would remooue from him the way of iniquitie. And Pſal. 1. he pronounceth him bleſſed, that hath not ſtood in the way of ſinners. And Salomon in his prouerbs, chap. 4.14. giueth a charge, Enter not into the way of the wicked, and walke not in the way of euill men: auoyd it and goe not by, turne from it, and paſſe by.</p>
               <p>A holy Father, S. Ambroſe, dooth vvell note the prophets ſpeech, in that he rather ſaith, Remoue the way of iniquitie, then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue the iniquity it ſelfe: and becauſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſhould haue auoyded the ſinne it ſelfe, if they had not entred into the way thereof. We read not of any great ſin, that wiſe king Salomon committed, beſide the multitude of his wiues, and his idolatry, for the which his poſterity was depriued of the greateſt part of his kingdom. But ſurdy he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer falne into idolatry, if hee had auoyded the occaſions thereof, and withſtoode the bewitching temptations of his idolatrous wiues. He married outlandiſh wiues, of ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Nations, and as hee doted vpon the women, ſo he could not auoid their ſtrange inticements. The occaſions were ſo great inforcements thereunto, that his wiſedome
<pb facs="tcp:20355:31"/>could not preuent it. Which occaſions had they not beene ſo forcible. God would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer haue giuen that forwarning as he did in his lawe. Deut. 7.17. Neyther ſhal he take him many wiues, leaſt his hart turne away (from the law of GOD,) 1. Kings. 11.4. Not onely the King, but the people alſo vvere debarred from marrying with idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous nations, leaſt they ſhould entice them to idolatry, as the daughters of Moab, by this meanes brought them to theyr ſhame. Numb. 25.1.2. and were the death of three and twenty thouſand of the Iſraelites. 1. Cor. 10.8.</p>
               <p>Then goeth he, and taketh to him ſeuen ſpirits worſe then himſelfe.]<note place="margin">The deuils crueltie.</note> The ſecond thing in his wofull returne, was his crueltie, ſeeking the vtter deſtruction of him whom hee recouereth, and hath drawne into his ſnares. And how ſhould not hee be vtterlie deſtroyed, which hath ſo great a company to come againſt him. Who when hee had enough, and more then hee could doe, of himſelfe to be deliuered but of one vnclean ſpirit, in what diſtreſſe &amp; lamentable eſtate ſhall he be, when ſeuen ſuch vncleane ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits enter poſſeſſion within him, and ſeuen worſe then the former?</p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:20355:31"/>
               <p>The number of ſeauen, is taken for an vncertaine number, for he bringeth manie more, and ſometimes a whole legion come together. Theſe ſpirits are worſe then him ſelfe, becauſe the latter ſinnes are far worſe then the former. Thys is a foule blotte of ingratitude in him or her, that falleth once and twice, and againe and often into his former iniquities, which hee hath by Gods grace ſo greatly deteſted: yea, and vowed the contrary.</p>
               <p>But as no man pittieth him who hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken loſſe vpon the ſeas, if hee aduenture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and ſuffer ſhypwracke, beeing in a manner brought to vtter pouertie before: ſo none lightly vvill haue compaſſion on them, vvho are nowe caſt away through theyr owne folly and negligence, &amp; whom no vvarning will ſerue to take heed of their future miſeries.</p>
               <p>Thus beeing iuſtlie forſaken of all pitty and compaſſion, the deuill he vvill be ſure to ſhewe them none. But as GOD and the Angels of heauen delight at the ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a finner, ſo the deuill reioyceth at no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more then at theyr deſtruction: for thys is his bootie and his pray, and his chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt tryumph.</p>

God ſhall wound the head of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and the hairie ſcalpe of ſuch a one, as goeth on ſtill in his wickednes.

               <p>Ezech. 3.20. If a righteous man turne from his righteouſneſſe, and commit ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, I will lay a ſtumbling block before him, and hee ſhall die.

All his righteouſnes that hee hath doone, ſhall not be mentioned, but in his tranſgreſſion that he hath committed, and in his ſin that he hath ſinned, in them ſhall he die. Were it not great follie in that man, which had brought great treaſure from a far country, with his owne danger and hazard, that hee ſhould venture all at the throwe of a Die, which hee hath laboured ſo painfully for: and ſhall we, for a little pleaſure of ſin, loſe all the hope of a vertuous life, &amp; runne into ſo great danger as may follow there-after? Yea, wee ſhall ſhewe our ſelues farre more mad, for he that hath loſt his treaſure, may vndertake the iourney, and bring as much more againe. But the preſumptuous ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, GOD forſaketh him, and ſildome or neuer doth helpe him.

But the Phiſition being out of ſight, if hee fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his hurtfull appetite, and fall into his ſicknes againe, the Phiſition being ſent for, is loath to meddle with him, and giues him vp to himſelfe, and makes him an aunſwere of deniall, leaueth him as one deſpairing of his health, ſeeing him ſo careleſſe and ſo
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:20355:45"/>witleſſe, that hee cannot tell what is good for himſelfe, and whom no counſell can make to beware, and to looke to himſelfe. Euen ſo God dealeth with that ſinner, that hauing beene often pardoned, and often cleanſed, yet will run headlong into his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſinnes againe, he then leaueth him to himſelfe; &amp; whom God forſaketh, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill lieth in waite for, as the Woolfe deuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that ſheepe which is without a Sheep-heard. Therefore the Lord ſpeaketh iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by his Prophet Ieremie. chap. 51. Wee would haue cured Babell, but ſhee would not be healed: let vs leaue her therfore, and come out of her, leaſt ye be pertakers of her ſins and of her puniſhments. And of Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem the Lord ſaith, Iere. 15. Who wil take pitty on Ieruſalem, &amp; who wil pray for her peace; thou haſt left me ſaith the Lord, &amp; haſt gone backward. As if he had ſaid, I wil heale thy malady no more. Pharaoh had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers plagues to heale him, but he continued in his ſtubbernes. God left him for the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of his ſins; for God denieth to ſuch ſinners, not only his effectuall helpe &amp; the power of his holy ſpirit to their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſion, but all other helps alſo, whereby other ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are allured vnto repentance.</p>

               <p>King Saule offended God greatly, he was pardoned, and had a faire warning, &amp; leaſt he ſhould offend againe, he had an eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all commaundement, but he fell afterward in ſuch ſort, that falling from God, he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer recouered againe, neither returned into fauour. The ſonnes of Ely were not obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient vnto the voyce of their Father, the reaſon is added, becauſe the Lord would deſtroy them for their manifold ſinnes, and that they vvere paſt amendement. And though Moſes, Noah, and Samuel, ſhould pray for ſuch people, the Lord would not heare them, neither would he be entreated in their behalfe.</p>
               <p>Now for a reſtoratiue in this wofull caſe,<note place="margin">A reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond falls.</note> this may be added, that no man or woman deſpaire, if they be not vtterly paſt grace, though they fall againe, ſeeing there is a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, betwixt a reſolute determination in ſinne, &amp; a repentant mind, which is har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily ſorry for euery fall and offence.</p>
               <p>Gods mercy doth often-times caſt out the deuill, that hee cannot haue any quiet poſſeſſion, and wandring in dry places, and being in his ſorrowful baniſhment, he is ſtill buſie with vs, to giue him entertainment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. Which we doe, as often as by ſinne
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:20355:46"/>we quench Gods ſpirit in vs, and haue not that reuerent, &amp; due, &amp; waighty conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods grace, as wee ought to haue. He that hath beene ſick and newly recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, vnleſſe he take great heed he falleth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his ſicknes againe: So we being newly cleanſed from our ſinne, through our neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence and careleſneſs fall many wayes into it againe. Firſt, becauſe we think our ſelues whole &amp; ſound, &amp; vpon a ſodaine are caſt downe againe. Againe, though ſin be for a while baniſhed, it is not cleane rooted out, for reliques remain, &amp; ſuch ſparkles which will kindle flames. We are ſleepy, and the deuill is too watchfull; the ſpirit is weake, &amp; the luſts of the fleſh too powerfull. The Iſraelites deliuered out of Aegipt, had the Philiſtimes to moleſt them, &amp; the deuil by his temptations, &amp; the world by euil coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, and euill example, are alwayes at our el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bowes, to trip vs and to giue vs a fall. The ſick man being newly recouered, muſt com to his ſtrength by dainty meates, &amp; he that is newly recouered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſinne, muſt ſeeke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter heauenly food, to make his ſoule ſtrong, as often prayer, hearing Sermons, reading of good bookes, and frequenting good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Let him not preſume of his ſtrength, nor thinke himſelfe too ſound, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers occaſions may make him fall againe. Still let him ſuſpect the worſt, and feare a fall; for he that will reſiſt the deuill, muſt ſtill ſtande armed. The body is kept in health by labour and exerciſe, and the ſoule if it will continue in a happy eſtate, muſt not onely auoide all euill works, to the beſt of our power; but wee muſt endeuour to practiſe all good workes, and ſo ſhall wee make our foundation ſo ſure, that nothing ſhall ouer-throw vs. And this ſhall be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, in ſteede of walls of braſſe, to keepe out the fierie darts, and fierce aſſaultes of the deuill.

                  </gap> ſinnes, if the deuill take new poſſeſſion, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hee hath beene throwne out, and ſo throw vs out of Gods fauour, and remoue vs from our happines, wherein wee were newly placed; Surely it may be well ſaid of vs, the laſt ſtate of that man ſhall be worſe then the firſt. Our great vnconſtancy, and weak frailty, and vile corruption, and moſt
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:20355:47"/>infected diſpotions, does heerein ſhew them ſelues, in that ſolemnly profeſſing our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance for any bad behauiour, and vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Lord, and with our ſelues, that no more wee will doe ſo, yet contrary both to promiſe and to purpoſe, we fall againe, into the ſelfe ſame offence and ſinne. And if the Lorde ſhould neuer receaue vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, after ſuch a tranſgreſſion, we had but what iuſtly and greatly we deſerued. Yet Gods mercy is more, not to embolden any to wickednes and impiety, but to comfort them that are inwardly greeued, with their great frailties. Wherefore, with deſire to ſtand, &amp; all poſſible endeuour againſt ſuch ſecond falls, let vs heare yet what the Lord ſaith, if in our great weaknes we doe fall, I meane into the ſame offence again after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. For we ſee the prophets in euery place exhort men to repentance, not which had once offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, but which with an obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tempt of God, had not ſtaied to run into all kind of wickednes, &amp; which after a ſhew of repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tance, yet returned to their ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full courſe again, the prophet Ieremy of all other is full of places, if you liſt to read any. Againe, the Lord in his law, would haue daily ſacrifices offred, ſomtime in the name
<pb facs="tcp:20355:48"/>of the whole people, ſomtime in the name of a priuate perſon, as well for offences co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by ignorance, as for voluntary tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions and falls, which aſſuredly ſhould not haue been done, except there had been mercy euen for ſecond falls. For the Lord would not deceaue his people with vaine figures. In the 78. Pſalm, we very plainly ſee, that God was entreated to forgiue moſt hipocriticall &amp; obſtinate ſinnes. And now in the time of his Goſpel, his goodnes is not ſtraited or deminiſhed, but euen now alſo more plainly it is proclaimed to the world, that at what time ſo euer a ſinner ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from his hart, there is pardon with the Lord, without exception againſt often co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of the ſame offence. When the Lord inioyneth vs to forgiue our brethren ſeauenty times feauen times, doth he meane new offences only, ſuch as they neuer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt vs before; or he meaneth all whatſoeuer, or how often ſo euer, fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to to by their frailty. And if ſo, doth he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire more mercy of man, then he the God of mercy wil ſhew; or ſhal the creature ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell the Creator in any goodnes? God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid. See it therefore, and be with comfort moſt aſſured of it, that if we ſin, not ſeauen
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:20355:48"/>times, but ſeauenty times ſeauen times a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Maieſtie, and euen in the ſame thing, and ſo often with weeping eyes and ſobbing ſoule, fall at his feete for mercy, for ſo great frailty, there is mercy with him, and pardon to true repentance.</p>
               <p>But take heede we turne not the grace of God into wantonnes &amp; preſumption.<note place="margin">Beware pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.</note> For if I ſeeke and ſuck out looſenes and liberty out of this doctrine, be ſure I ſauour it to death and not vnto life. And what know I, whether euer I ſhall haue grace truly to repent, what ſo boldly and preſumptuouſly I haue dared to commit. When the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith, If any man ſinne, we haue an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocate with the Father, Ieſus Chriſt the righteous, and he is the propitiation for our ſinnes; doe ye think we may tie this, to on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuch ſinns, as were neuer committed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, without a very plaine and great iniury to that place of Scripture? No, no, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, &amp; therefore a true ground of comfort, euen for ſinns often fallen into, ſo that frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and not looſenes be the cauſe. Reade the ninth of Daniel, and ſee if he confeſſe not ſinne often committed, and as it were in a continued courſe, and yet deſpaireth not of mercy. What meaneth that article of our
<pb facs="tcp:20355:49"/>faith, I beleeue the forgiuenes of ſins? ſhall we gloſe vpon it thus, that is of ſuch ſinnes as I neuer committed but once. Surely if we doe, it muſt be ſaid, curſed be the gloſe that corrupteth the text. For that article comprizeth all ſinne, before baptiſme, and after baptiſme, before repentance, and after repentance, euer through the courſe of my life, in this world whatſoeuer it is, how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſo euer I haue ſlided into it through frailty; yet God giuing me true repentance for it, I beleeue the forgiuenes of it. Yea, it is that ſpirituall comfort, that cannot be ſpoken of ſufficiently, neyther can wee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the depth or heigth thereof; to wit, that GOD would haue his children, ſo ſure of the pardon of their ſinnes, euen of all their ſins, without exception: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he giueth them a diſlike, and true abbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, as that he would haue it an article of their faith, ſo that they ſhould not be ſound Chriſtians, if they beleeued it not. Laſtly, euen the petition in the Lords prayer, cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning daily forgiuenes of daily treſpaſſes, dare you reſtaine it, to treſpaſſes commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted onely before repentance, and exempt all ſecond falls, after ſuch repentance and purpoſe to amend, the Lord forbid. And
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:20355:49"/>therefore take it alſo with the former, as a ſure proofe of pardon alſo, for theſe offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Onely let mee admoniſh you, which I cannot too often ſpeake of; beware pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, beware looſenes, beware negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and haue due care to auoide theſe ſecond falls. And ſay not God is mercifull, and therefore I will ſin, Ro 6.1. For as he is gracious to a ſorowful ſinner, ſo is he dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to a preſumptuous offender; and frailty ſhall find mercy, when boldnes ſhall finde iudgement and wrath for euer.</p>
               <p>The godly, although they fall through the infirmity and weakenes of the fleſh, yet they doe not giue their conſent to ſin, but by mourning ſtriue againſt it, being ſorry they cannot haue the better hand, being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed of themſelues. So that they may truly ſay with the Apoſtle, Ro. 7. The e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill which I would not doe, that doe I.</p>
               <p>And if Manaſſes, after ſo many abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations found fauour with God, as his ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall prayer doth teſtifie, why ſhould the godly mind be caſt away in deſpaire. And though it ſeeme ſomewhat impertinent to this purpoſe, let vs beholde the eſtate of King Solomon, beeing ſo rarely endued with wiſedome, &amp; the knowledge of Gods
<pb facs="tcp:20355:50"/>ſeruice, yet fell away by idolatry; of whom ſome doubt whether he were condemned. Yet that it was not ſo, theſe reaſons briefly ſet downe,<note place="margin">Reaſons to prooue why Solomon was not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</note> may perſwade vs. Firſt, that he was a figure of Chriſt. Secondly, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his moſt excellent prayer, which hee made at the dedication of the temple, a note of Gods ſpirit inhabiting in him, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo did worthily ſhew it ſelf in his moſt rare wiſedome. Thirdly, for his repentance, teſtified in his booke called Eccleſiaſtes. Fourthly, becauſe God loued him. 2. Sa. 12.24. As it is ſaide of Eſau and Iacob, God hated the one, and loued the other, Ro. 9.13. and whom God loueth he loueth to the end. Ioh. 13, 1. Alſo the gifts and calling of God are without repentance, Ro. 11.29. Fiftly, for Gods promiſe. Pſ. 89. My mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy will I keepe for him for euermore, my louing kindnes will I not take from him. My couenant wil I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.</p>
               <p>No reaſon therefore there is, for any of vs to deſpaire of Gods grace and goodnes, if there be any ſparke of grace left within vs; in the meane time let vs take heed, that we quench not the ſpirit, and bring ſorrow to our ſelues, and danger to our ſoules. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:20355:50"/>the moſt bad nature of mankinde is ſuch, and we become ſuch greeuous offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and ſo careleſſe with all of our owne ſaluation, and ſo wholy giuen vp to the world, and to the vanities &amp; pleaſures ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that vnleſſe the Lord by his ſurpaſſing &amp; wonderfull mercy, ſhould turne vs vnto repentance, by more great vehement, and weighty helps of his grace, then commonly are to be ſeene, and more mightily &amp; graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſhould mollifie our hard and ſtony harts, and breake and tame our euill diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, and bring vnder our froward and ſtubborn wills, to the obedience of his moſt holy will, ſurely we ſhould neuer continue in a good courſe, but fall away from God, and from our owne ſaluation.</p>
               <p>Seeing therefore it is ſo hard to be wone to God, let vs take heede how we fall away from God; and if we haue offended &amp; be forgiuen, and often forgiuen, let vs remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the warning Chriſt gaue to the woman taken in adultery, Goe thy wayes and ſinne no more. Shimei that curſed Dauid, and had his pardon graunted him, on that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition he ſhould not goe out of Ieruſalem, forgetting his promiſe, that ſtood vpon ſo waighty a condition, as the hazzard of his
<pb facs="tcp:20355:51"/>life, through a ſmall occaſion, for couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to recouer his ſeruant that was gone fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, loſt his life, without any more fauour or hope of mercy. At which time alſo his former wickedne<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s was brought to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, &amp; his puniſhment pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced to be ſo much the iuſter for that. So let vs lay this example to our hart, &amp; take heede of the leaſt occaſions of ſin, leaſt after wee haue repented &amp; vowed amendement, we be taken tardy in our owne negligence and forgetfulnes, and all our former wickednes layd to our charge, and no fauour &amp; mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie any more to be graunted. Remember Lots wife, 2. Pet. 2.19. For of whom ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer a man is ouercome, euen vnto the ſame is he in bondage.</p>
               <p>And if we, after wee haue eſcaped from the filthineſſe of the worlde, through the knowledge of the Lord, and of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Ieſus Chriſt, are yet intangled againe therein, and ouercome, our latter end ſhall be worſe then our beginning. pſalm. 125.5. The Lorde will be good to thoſe that are true of hart; and as for ſuch as turne backe vnto theyr owne wickednes, the Lord will leade them forth with the euill dooers. If a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny with-draw himſelfe, ſaith the Lord, my
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:20355:51"/>ſoule ſhall haue no pleaſure in him. Let vs often remember that warning, with due co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, which I haue already ſpoken vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you of; Sin no more, leaſt a worſe thing come vnto thee. 2. Cor. 2.11.

Pet. 3.17. Ye therefore beloued, ſeeing ye know theſe things before, beware, leaſt ye be alſo plucked away, with the euill conuerſation of the wicked, &amp; fall from your own ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtnes.

Whereby I am perſwaded, that there is no ſuch gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous ſinner, nor hainous offender, vvhich would not turn vnto God, if he conſider in this example gods goodnes &amp; bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tifulnes, and the entire loue of ſo mercifull a Father, which of his own gracious accord, went out
<pb facs="tcp:20355:54"/>to meete his prodigall ſonne, and to receiue him without any ſhew of deniall; contrary to the cuſtome of earthly Fathers, vvhich fret and fume, and are hardly drawne to ſuch mercy. How kindly doth he embrace him, array him, put a ring on his finger, kill the fatted calfe for him, make merry &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce for him. And howe farre of hee was fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> caſting in his teeth, his former euill life, that he maketh no mention thereof, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther findeth fault vvith the elder brother that repined thereat, ſeeking to ſatiſ-fie and appeaſe him.</p>
               <p>The younger ſonne, not in age but in manners, not in yeeres, but in want of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, whereby he is the more eaſily incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and drawne vnto bad wayes. Some a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged men, are but young in theyr wordes, geſture, and conuerſation: and theſe the prophet Eſay, 65. calleth young men of an hundred yeeres old. Some are young men concerning their time, &amp; yet are aged men in good behauiour, as Ioſeph, Dauid, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muell, Daniell, Iohn Baptiſt. According to that the Lord ſaid vnto Moſes, Numb. 11. Gather vnto me ſeuenty men, whom thou knoweſt to be auncient in diſcretion, giuen to be vertuous and godly, &amp; well diſpoſed.</p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:20355:54"/>
               <p>The fooliſhnes and lightnes of a ſinner is heere ſet forth, in that he is termed a young man. For, for the moſt part they know but little, and haue experience but of a fewe matters, they are vnskilfull in theyr owne affayres, and ſtand in great neede of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell.</p>
               <p>If this prodigall Sonne, left his Fathers houſe,<note place="margin">Fooliſhnes.</note> and ſought his owne decay and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, it was through his owne folly, where-with hee was ouer-ruled, and head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long carried away. As fore-caſt is more worth then great maintenaunce: ſo is wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome the diſpoſer &amp; the continuer of great wealth. Children conſider no more then that which is before theyr eyes, neyther doe they fore-caſt things to come. Deut. 32. O that they were wiſe, then woulde they vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand this, they would conſider theyr latter end. And our Sauiour Chriſt ſaith, Luke. 19. O that they had known the time of theyr viſitation, at the leaſt in thys theyr day. The Apoſtle Saint Paule wiſheth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery where vnto the faithfull, that they bee filled with the knowledge of God. For it is no meruaile, if God be forſaken of them to whom hee is not knowne, which neyther heare the worde of God, nor haue it, nor
<pb facs="tcp:20355:55"/>make any care or regard thereof.</p>
               <p>The prodigall ſonne vnderſtood not the great bleſſings that vvere in his Fathers houſe, but afterward affliction gaue him to vnderſtand, when he felt the want thereof. So we leaue God &amp; fall into ſinne,<note place="margin">Blindnes.</note> becauſe we know not the miſchiefes that flow from thence. Were it not that the Hawkes eyes were hidde, and his feete tyed, hee would mount aloft into the skies: ſo if the eyes of our minde were not blinded with worldlie pleaſures and vanities, wee ſhould ſure be lifted vp with heauenly thoughts, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe theſe earthly delights. For all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities and pleaſures of this life, haue but a ſhort time of continuance, Phil. 3. Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners continuing in theyr ſinfull race, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly blinded, that they cannot ſee the light of God, nor finde the way to come out of theyr lothſome darkneſſe. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there be many ſins, ſome of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and ſome of malice, yet ignorance is the roote of all. For when we know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be a God or a deuill, heauen or hell, ioyes or torments, no meruaile if wee wilfully runne into all wickedneſſe. All vvhich, if the ſinner did well knovve and beleeue, hee would not ſo eaſily offend as
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:20355:55"/>he doth, at leaſt-wiſe hee would not fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſo many and ſo great and dangerous ſins as he doth, and that daily.</p>
               <p>No man ſinneth, but hee that ſeeth not what hee looſeth by ſinning. Therefore let vs pray with the prophet. pſalme. 12. Lord lighten mine eyes, that I fall not in death. And pſalm. 118. Giue mee vnderſtanding, and I will ſearch thy law, yea I will keepe it with my whole hart. Let vs deſire true knowledge, that we doe not leaue GOD, that wee may remaine with him, and be in his houſe, be content to be ruled by him, &amp; keepe his commaundements.</p>
               <p>Not onely ignorance of Gods goodnes, bleſſings, gyfts and graces, doth turne vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from God,<note place="margin">Confidence in his owne wiſedom.</note> but alſo the confidence in our owne ſtrength, our owne ſelfe will, and our owne ſelfe-loue. No perſwaſions can alter a young mans mind, and a wilful ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, vntill he haue fully tryed his own way. Beyond all meaſure they truſt too much to themſelues, to their own ſtrength and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, policy and fetches, thinking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to be of ſuch good gouernment, that they know well enough, how to order &amp; to diſpoſe their owne matters. And this ſelfe wiſdom, is the cauſe that many forſake god.
<pb facs="tcp:20355:56"/>Therefore the Lord ſaith, Reuel. 3. Thou ſayeſt, I am rich, and want nothing, and knoweſt not that thou art miſerable, and poore, and blind, and naked. But how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle wee are able to doe without Gods helpe and grace, ſhall be ſhewed hereafter. Peter was bold, and preſumed ſaying, Though all men be offended, yet will not I be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended; who becauſe he truſted too much to his owne ſtrength, was ouer-come by a filly maid. Mat. 26. So alſo Dauid heerein confeſſeth his owne fault, Pſal, 29. I ſayde in my proſperitie, I ſhall neuer be remoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and preſently after, Thou turnedſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way thy face from me, and I was troubled. And hauing full tryall in himſelfe, hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proueth them which put not theyr truſt in God. Pſal. 52.8. Loe, this is the man that tooke not God for his ſtrength, but truſted vnto the multitude of his riches, and ſtrengthned himſelfe in his wickednes.</p>
               <p>But now let vs heare this fooliſh young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,<note place="margin">Father. &amp;c.</note> and prodigall waſter. [Father, ſayth he, giue mee the portion of the goods that falleth to mee.] This portion is that gift of reaſon &amp; vnderſtanding, which God hath imparted vnto vs. As if he had ſaid, Father, giue me leaue to liue as I liſt, and to doe as
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:20355:56"/>I thinke good. Heere-hence commeth all the miſchiefes and inconuences in the world, eyther becauſe men deſire to doe what they liſt, or elſe, becauſe men regarde not to liue after Gods will, and in his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. He would be like vnto God, to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all thinges according to his pleaſure. Thys pride and ſelfe-will, is the heginning of all ſinne in the world, which maketh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> accurſed that are thereto addicted. He ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth off his fathers gouernment, &amp; his own will muſt ſtand for a law. Selfe-loue ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwes iudgement, darkneth ſence &amp; rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, poyſoneth the will, and hindereth the courſe of ſaluation, ſhutting vp all paſſage thereunto. For ſuch men as are ſo intang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the loue of themſelues, neyther know God, nor loue theyr neighbour, nor ſeeke after vertue; but onely minde thoſe things whereby they may aduaunce them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, gaping for honour, and hunting af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter promotion.</p>
               <p>Free-will doth vnderprop this ſelfe-loue,<note place="margin">Freewill.</note> which of it ſelfe is but a weake ſtay. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though by ſin our free-will be not vtterlie taken away, in naturall and morall actions, yet neuertheleſſe, it remaineth ſo weake &amp; vnable, and ſo defaced in ſpirituall matters,
<pb facs="tcp:20355:57"/>that it cannot reſiſt any temptations. But as a ſhip in the Sea hauing loſt her rudder, is toſſed to and fro with the leaſt blaſt of wind: So this free-will of ours, vnleſſe it be conformed by repentance and humilitie, &amp; framed a newe by yeelding our ſelues to Gods gracious direction, (for of our ſelues we are not able ſo much as to think a good thought,) it is ſo crazed and ſo wauering, that it is eaſilie ouerthrowne, by euerie temptation of the fleſh, the world, and the deuill.</p>
               <p>Before the fal of our firſt parents, our free will was perfect, inclining to all goodnes, but after theyr fall, it became ſubiect to ſin, and to damnation, from the which it could not be deliuered, but by the grace of Chriſt our Sauiour and Redeemer. Yet the wil of man hath not altogether loſt his force and freedome, beeing ruled by deliberation, iudgement, aduice, and conſent. Without me, ye can doe nothing, ſaith Chriſt. Iohn. 15. Where our power to doe good is taken away, not our free-will.</p>
               <p>The infant hath power to goe, but is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect euery minute to a fall: So the weake will of man, hath ſome power and libertie, but yet without the helpe &amp; grace of God,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:20355:57"/>it cannot frame it ſelfe the right way, to the courſe of a better life, to continue in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, no more then a chylde can goe farre without the helpe of his Nurſe and guide, to ſtay and to direct him. The infant that is falne, cannot riſe without the helpe of his Nurſe; and we that are falne into ſinne, can not riſe from ſinne our ſelues, neither haue we power to leaue ſinne, or to embrace the good inſpirations of Gods holy Spirit, or to refuſe and reſiſt the deuils temptations, without the ſpeciall grace of God, vvhich onely can raiſe vs, and giue vs courage and comfort vnto all godlines.</p>
               <p>The infant, although he be ledde by the hand of the Nurſe, may be vnwilling to go, ſo a ſinner may be obſtinate and continue in his ſinnes, although he be directed, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, and puniſhed by Gods hand. All euill deedes come through our owne free-vvill, but all good purpoſes, come from the inſpiration of Gods grace. For after the fall of our firſt Parents, vvee were borne the chyldren of vvrath, and conceaued in ſinne, and by the force of our free-will, we coulde neyther riſe from ſinne, nor yet fulfull the commaundements of almightie GOD.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:20355:58"/>
               <p>Nay, although wee haue obtained Gods grace, and forgiuenes of our ſinnes, yet are we not of force enough to ouer-come the deuils temptations, and to auoyd our fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly luſts, vnleſſe by the continuall and dailie helpe of GOD, wee be ſtrengthned in the gift of perſeuerance to a godly life. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hence it is manifeſt, that ſeeing we can doe ſo little of our owne ſelues, that it is great raſhnes too much to preſume of our owne ſtrength, and to truſt to our own wiſedom, whereby we may think our ſelues wel able, to rule and gouerne our ſelues through our owne direction.</p>
               <p>This made the prodigall ſonne too foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhly, and like a chylde that wants diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to deſire to liue according to his owne libertie. God draweth not any one againſt his will to ſaluation, but ſuffereth the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to take theyr owne courſe. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digall ſonnes father did not hold him, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing willing to depart: neyther doth hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force him to depart, beeing willing to ſtay. The portion of goods which GOD doth giue to euery one, is to ſome eloquence, to other-ſome, wiſedom or riches, or ſtrength, or knowledge, or place of honor, all which wee are giuen moſt eaſily to abuſe, as thys
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:20355:58"/>prodigall Sonne ſpent his portion waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. And this is worthy to be noted, and daily to be ſeene by common experience, that they that haue the beſt gifts, do eyther not vſe them at all, or elſe apply them to an euill end, not to commend Gods graces in them, but to make themſelues the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable.</p>
               <p>And not long after.] For of our ſelues we cannot long ſtand, but wee fall quicklie and ſuddenly, as ſoone as God with-draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his hand. And the deuill ſleepeth not, but watcheth &amp; ſeeketh all occaſions, how hee may ouerthrow that man or that vvo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, whom he ſeeth deſtitute of Gods help and grace; the deuill hath ſome-what to ſet him aworke, vntil he hath brought to paſſe his owne deſtruction. When our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents were left to themſelues, through the high conceit of ambition, they threw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues downe into great miſery, vvhile the deuill in the meane time perſwaded them to be as Gods.</p>
               <p>When the younger ſonne had gathered all together.<note place="margin">When &amp;c.</note>] We being fully fraught with Gods gifts, either wiſedome, riches, honor, ſtrength, or the like, we begin to take pride, and think there ſhall be no alteration. This
<pb facs="tcp:20355:59"/>prodigall ſon thought himſelfe in ſo good caſe, and ſo well prouided, that no thought of future miſery did once enter into his minde, as though it were vnpoſſible that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he ſhould feele the miſery of aduerſity, thinking no other but that his wealth and proſperous eſtate, ſhould neuer come to an end. Hee left his Fathers houſe, truſting to his treaſure, and to his wit, and ſo begins to dig downe his mountaine, which afterward came to à mole-hill.<note place="margin">Proſperitie abuſed.</note> But marke howe hee lifts himſelfe aloft, hauing gathered all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Saul being of low degree, and in his Fathers houſe, amongſt the common ſort, liued well, and commendably, but hauing obtained a kingdome, hee left the Lord, &amp; did much wickednes. Dauid, beeing as yet a ſhepheard, and perſecuted by king Saul, his life was without blame; but when God gaue him reſt fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all his enemies, then did he commit adultery and murder.</p>
               <p>Heere wee may learne to take diſlike, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the riches, honours, and proſperous eſtate of this world. For, for want of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and through negligence, great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger commeth at vnawares. In the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of Gilboa, King Saul and his ſonnes were ſlaine, and in the honours and proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:20355:59"/>of the world, vertue dooth oftentimes take a fall. Proſperity at the firſt ſhew ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth moſt ſweet and pleaſant, but bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth there-withall great dangers to the ſoule, if they be not wiſely preuented. In proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie therefore thinke of aduerſity, &amp; ſo the thought of alteration &amp; change, ſhal breed wiſedome and moderation. The pride of proſperitie caſt downe this prodigall Son into extreame miſery. Haman was happy when he was in fauour with the King, but in his greateſt iolity, his deſtruction vvas then moſt neere. The ſame fell out to Pharao and Senacharib, the one beeing drowned in the Red-ſea, the other bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtabd in by his owne ſonnes. But when this prodigall Sonne had this libertie, let vs ſee what hee did, and how hee imployed himſelfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> He tooke his iourny into a far country.] Farre away, hee thought not himſelfe farre enough. But who willed him to depart, who put him out of the houſe?<note place="margin">Into a farre Country.</note> His Father ſent him out into baniſhment, neyther vvilled him to go out of his houſe, but he himſelfe, no body denying him, of his ovvne accord, or rather through his owne lightneſſe hee went away, and left his Fathers houſe. So
<pb facs="tcp:20355:60"/>the ſinner of his owne accord, dooth leaue the gouernment of his heauenly Father, &amp; doth make a voluntary ſeparation,<note place="margin">Will.</note> refuſing the direction of Gods word, the counſell of the godly, &amp; of their faithfull friendes, yea ſpurning againſt the ſecret warning of their owne conſcience.</p>
               <p>No doubt many about his Father, gaue him counſel to the contrary, but they could not turne his mind, all meanes were aſſaied, but nothing woulde ſerue the turne, nor beate backe the humor of his licentious li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, his ſtubborne will coulde not be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, his minde muſt needes bee fulfilled. Vnder this parable, the lawleſſe affections of many young men are ſette downe. For this prodigall ſonne liueth yet, and will do, vntill the worlds end. But if they wil needs goe, and will needes haue their ſwinge and ſway, if they will needes run their race, they haue theyr time, euen ſuch a time, that god doth leaue them to themſelues. For God doth not for ſake any, till hee be firſt forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. And if we will needs goe, be it known vnto vs, that we runne vpon our manifeſt hazzard &amp; danger. For who can tell whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this diſordered courſe, he ſhal come to miſchiefe, or to ſome miſerable end, or
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:20355:60"/>whether God will ſhew him mercy, that he may cal himſelfe to better reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance. As we read Eccles. 11. Reioyce ô young man, &amp;c. God worketh with thoſe that flie from him diuers wayes, eyther by ſecrete croſſes and afflictions, or by open puniſhments &amp; miſerable ends. 1. Tim. 5.24. or els by gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vnto ſome the gracious gift of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Hee runneth far that neuer returnes, as indeede many are ſo deſperatly bent that they neuer returne. But into this prodigall ſonne, God poured ſuch abundance of his mercy, that it had his iſſue in plentifull teares, and he became a new man. And ſo happy was his conuerſion, that his Father had great ioy thereof, expreſſing the ſame in diuers comfortable tokens.</p>
               <p>Out of this example we may gather, that the cauſe of ſin is our owne will, not God, or the deuill; yea, our owne ſinfull fleſh, how ſoeuer many can make blind excuſes, for theyr owne euill life. The firſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of all euill is to turne away from God. The children of men, ſaith the Prophet, pſal. 62.9. are deceitfull vpon the weights: For in one ballance they put their pleaſures and profits, in another they place GOD and heauenly conſiderations, making the
<pb facs="tcp:20355:61"/>one to weigh a great deale lighter then the other; making more account of earthlie things then of God, whom we ſhould loue aboue all, with all our hart, and with all our ſoule. All that God hath done for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they conſider not, and they altogether neglect. Your ſinnes, ſaith the prophet Eſay, haue made a ſeparation betwixt you and your God. A falſe ballance is an abhomination vnto god, prou. 11, 1.</p>
               <p>This prodigall ſonne, as a man of no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience went raſhly to worke,<note place="margin">Raſhnes.</note> neyther did he conſider what good things hee enioyed in his Fathers houſe, nor what he loſt, nor yet howe great danger hee did vnder-take. He little conſidered the manifold inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences that fall out in this life. Hee that is too raſh, ſhall afterward repent. Man ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in haſt, becauſe hee cannot a little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraine his wilful affection, before he do du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and wiſely conſider the end of ſin, &amp; the euil ſucceſſe therof. But if we could refraine our ſelues, and not ruſh on ſo haſtily, little conſidering the danger of our ſoules, vvee would not run on into ſuch head-long ſin. Therfore Dauid ſaid. pſal. 118. I conſidered my waies, &amp; turned my feete vnto thy teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies. The Bethulians were too raſh to
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:20355:61"/>yeeld themſelues to Holofernes, if God did not helpe them within fiue daies. As oft as thé people of Iſraell came to Moſes, before he would giue them an aunſwere, he asked counſel of God. O that we would take this courſe, as oft as the deſire of reuenge, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, or luſt ſhould prouoke our mindes, not to giue any of theſe any aunſwere, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till we had asked counſell of god; but wee aunſwere haſtily &amp; raſhly, not conſidering god nor his commaundements, &amp; ſo runne into diuers miſchiefes and dangers. Ioſua raſhly beleeuing the Gibeonites was decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. Good aduiſement muſt goe before good deeds, much more before euill deeds. The virgine Mary, before ſhee aunſwered the Angell, did wiſely conſider what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſalutation that ſhould be. A fooliſh Nation Deut. 32. without counſel &amp; wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, doth not conſider nor forecaſt their latter end. Dauid too haſtily beleeuing Sheba, his lying tale, did great wrong to Mephiboſheth, contrary to his couenaunt. VVhen the woman taken in adultery vvas brought before our ſauiour Chriſt, he made a ſtay before he ſpake his mind. When A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chab was throughly bent to warre, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Micheas warned him hee ſhould not
<pb facs="tcp:20355:62"/>doe it, hee tooke not his warning, but the King was one of the firſt that died, nay the onely man, and none but he that periſhed. For the King of Aram made proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, on, fight neyther againſt ſmall nor great, ſaue onely againſt the King of Iſraell. And when the King was ſmitten, the battel was ended. 1. Reg. 22.34.36. So the ſinner which is as it were bewitched, and too much giuen to any ſinne, no warning of Preachers, nor counſell of friends, ſhall vvithdraw him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſin, or bring him to amendement, vntill his owne rod hath made him ſmart, or his own deſerued deſtruction hath made an vtter end of him. As alſo on the contrary ſide, there be bad companions to perſwade him and to harden him in his ſin, that hee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not turne backe, nor ſo much as haue any leyſure to entertaine a thought of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Therfore, if thou wilt not goe wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring out of the way of life, lay aſide thy diſordered paſſions &amp; affections.</p>
               <p>Balaam, before hee went to curſe the people of God, asked counſell of God, &amp; had the deniall, yet through the deſire of rewards and promotion, hee was fooliſhlie led along to his owne deſtruction. GOD opened the mouth of his Aſſe, &amp; hee gaue
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:20355:62"/>him warning, and it would not be: his eyes were opened as Eliſha his ſeruant to ſee the hoaſt that compaſſed Eliſha, and he ſaw an Angell with a drawne ſword, ready to ſley him, yet muſt he needs goe forward whom the deuill driues. When thou art ſet to ſin, thy conſcience doth reproue thee, but thou wilt not be warned, and beateſt it backe: therefore, if thou payeſt for it by Gods cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and puniſhment, gods iudgement is iuſt, &amp; thou haſt cauſe to condemne thy owne wilfulnes, as many doe when they are brought to lamentable ends. Therfore the Wiſe man ſaith. Ecclus. 18. Goe not after thy concupiſcence, nor followe not the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticement of thy luſt, let reaſon and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment take place, &amp; pray with the prophet, pſalm. 17. O Lord lighten my darknes. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery determination goeth awry, vvhich proceedeth rather from thy will, then from reaſon and iudgement.</p>
               <p>The Iewes hauing theyr choyce, rather call for Barrabas to be deliuered the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt, and wee iudge them woorthy of extreame puniſhment, that were ſo vniuſt in theyr verdict, and ſo wicked in their conſent. But conſider thy ſelfe, and thou makeſt a farre worſe choyce; for thou yeeldeſt thy ſelfe to
<pb facs="tcp:20355:63"/>ſin, and giueſt thy ſoule to the deuill, refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Chriſt &amp; thine own ſaluation. Heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſhewing thy ſelfe farre worſe then euer the Iewes were in theyr choyce. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digall ſonne had rather follow his luſt, then obey his father, and made more choyce of his owne licentious libertie, then of all the benefits that were to be had in his Fathers houſe: So the ſinner maketh more account of his owne ſinfull delights, then of all the ioyes of heauen.</p>
               <p>The prodigall ſonne goeth into a farre country,<note place="margin">Degrees in finning.</note> and one ſinner goeth farther from god then another, ſome ſinne of infirmitie, ſome of ignorance, &amp; ſome of malice, ſome of preſumption, and ſome againſt the holy Ghoſt. Many, thinke they cannot run far enough from god, of whom the prophet ſpeaketh, pſalm. 139. Whether ſhall vvee flie from gods preſence: Shall we flie into heauen? it is no part of our thought. Shall we flie into the vttermoſt part of the earth, the whole world is vnder Gods gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Shal we flie into hel? no ſay we, that way of all other we would eſcape &amp; auoid, although indeed we make choyce of it, and the broade way that leadeth to deſtruction is more beaten. Why if it were there, ſurely
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:20355:63"/>gods hand would finde vs out there. Shall wee take a long voyage by ſea, into ſome new-found Land: it may be God wil ſend vs further then we are minded to flie. For little did Ionas thinke by flying from God, that god would ſend him into the bottome of the ſea. For though Ionas returned from death to life, yet was that a rare example of gods mercie, and the like puniſhment ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be feared, then ſuch a ſtrange euent to be looked &amp; hoped for. Well, if we will not venture ſo farre, but onely flie into the darknes, we muſt know that with God, the darknes and light are all one. Ecclus. 23.18. And although Adam hid himſelfe from gods preſence, yet was he ſtill in gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, neither could he eſcape.</p>
               <p>He that trauels into a farre country, may meete with theeues to ſpoyle him, may wander into deſerts and vnknowne wayes, may light among wild beaſtes that may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure him. Howſoeuer, hee ſhall come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong vnknown people, whoſe conditions he may feare, but ſcarcely truſt, and ſooner ſhall he fall into the company of bad co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, then of thoſe that ſhal do him good, or haue care of his welfare. All theſe dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers &amp; inconueniences might hee auoyde,
<pb facs="tcp:20355:64"/>by remaining in his Fathers houſe, &amp; yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding himſelfe into his fathers gouernment. The prophet Eſay, chap. 29. maketh men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome, that did honour God vvith theyr lips, but theyr harts were farre from him. But how can it be, that ſeeing God is euery where, that any of vs all can goe farre from him. As the prophet Dauid ſayth: pſalme. 139. Whether ſhall I goe from thy preſence? If I goe vp into heauen, thou art there: if I goe downe into hell, thou art there alſo. If I take the wings of the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and remaine in the vttermoſt parts of the ſea, euen there alſo, &amp;c. There is no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of place betwixt God and the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, for God by his power and omnipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie is euery where, neither can wee eſcape gods preſence. But the ſinner goeth farre away from the Lord, by his rebellious will. Honour thy father and thy mother. Thou ſhalt not kill, ſteale, beare falſe witnes, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uet. The practiſe of a ſinner is quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary vnto theſe, as the common experience of the world doth ſhew.</p>
               <p>The Scribes &amp; Phariſes loued that which Chriſt hated, and hated that which Chriſt commaunded. Either in thought, word, or deede, wee are quite contrary vnto Gods
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:20355:64"/>law, and ſo goe far away from him. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the prophet ſaith well, Health and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation is far from the ſinner, becauſe they haue refuſed the righteouſnes of God. The ſinner is ſeparated from GOD, by his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly behauiour and wicked deedes. Hee goeth fartheſt from god, that committeth the greateſt ſinne: as hee that doth wrong to his parents, rather then he which hurteth his neighbour, and hee ſinneth more that killeth his neighbour, then hee that luſteth after another mans wife. Being in the eſtate of grace our ſinne is greater, then when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we taſted Gods goodnes, &amp; had a fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling thereof: and when thou haſt forſaken the world, to cleaue againe to the world &amp; to embrace it, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou haſt repented thee of thy ſin, and then to fall into it againe, is a greater offence. Of whom Chriſt ſayth: Nowe thou art clenſed ſin no more, leaſt a worſe thing come vnto thee.</p>
               <p>Thou goeſt farre from God, by adding and multiplying thy ſinne, ſo that thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſeſt or neglecteſt all good exhortations and warnings. Many goe farre away from God,<note place="margin">Sinne by degrees.</note> not vpon the ſuddaine, but by little and little. For as many ſickneſſes goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore death, ſo many ſinnes goe before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.
<pb facs="tcp:20355:65"/>Firſt a diſlike of goodnes, and then a loathing, and ſo by little and little we are with-drawne from godlines, and vvee which heretofore were earneſt profeſſours, become key-colde in religion, and in the works of charitie. Firſt Eue ſaw the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den fruite, then ſhe deſired it, then ſhee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted it, then ſhee gaue it to her husband. Caine, &amp; the brethren of Ioſeph, firſt tooke a diſlike, then came enuy, then hatred, then murder. Potiphers wife firſt luſted, then was not aſhamed to open her luſtfull in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, being denied, ſhee defamed him, and prouoked her husbands great diſpleaſure againſt him, that hee was thrown into pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
               <p>But how great an inconuenience it is, to goe farre from GOD,<note place="margin">What it is to depart from God.</note> this example of the prodigall ſonne doth ſhewe, who leauing his fathers houſe, founde nothing elſe but famine and miſery. VVhat found Hagar, beeing out of Abrahams houſe, but vvant and ſorrow. Gen. 16. They that forſake the Lord, ſhall haue great trouble. The Chic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens that are in dangers of the Kite, ſo long as they flock about the Henne are ſafe, but when they goe ſtragling, they are caught vp; So they that make the Lorde their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:20355:65"/>&amp; are guided by him, they are in ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, but when they depart from him, &amp; goe far away, the deuill goeth about like a roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Lion, ſeeking whom he may deuoure. 1. Pet. 5. VVhen Caine went away from god, there was no more account made of him, then of a vagabond and odious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Gen. 4.14. Behold, ſaith hee to God, thou haſt caſt me out this day fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the earth, and from thy face ſhall I be hid, and ſhal be a vagabond and a runagate vpon the earth, and who ſoeuer findeth me, ſhall ſley mee. This is the dangerous &amp; fearefull eſtate of them, which committing ſin, depart from God.</p>
               <p>But among many inconueniences and dangers, theſe that follow are woorthy the noting. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, they that depart from God, make but little account of him, which is the chiefeſt good, and from whom al bleſſings, gifts and graces doe proceede. For great things, when they are a farre off from our ſight, doe ſeeme but ſmall. The great maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie of God, to idle &amp; negligent beholders, ſeemeth a matter of ſmall account, whereby the maieſtie of GOD is neuer awhit the more diminiſhed, but our corruption and naughty nature is made the more apparant.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:20355:66"/>
               <p>They that ſell wares, forſwear the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues for a little gaine, making more account of a little ſiluer, then of Gods commandement. And becauſe our loue is more ſet vppon theſe worldly and tranſitory thinges then vpon God, therefore is God ſo ſlenderlie regarded. The Apoſtle S. Paule, becauſe hee made ſo ſlender account of this world, therefore he truly ſaid, I account all things but dung: and when hee maketh mention of God, hee ſpeaketh with great reuerence. Tit. 2.13. Looking (ſaith he) for the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed hope, and appearing of the glory of the mightie GOD. Hebr. 12.29. Our God is euen a conſuming fire. So likewiſe in the pſalmes. The Lord is a great god aboue all gods. pſalm. 89.6. to 10. Great is the Lord our god, and there is not end of his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. pſalme. 47.2. Hee is the great King vpon all the earth. verſe 8. God raigneth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the heathen: God fitteth vpon his holy mountaine. pſalme. 144.5. and 146. And how is, it that we make ſo light account of god, but that we prefer the leaſt thinges in the world before him.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, as the further thou art from the Sunne, the greater is thy ſhadow, ſo the further thou departeſt from GOD, the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:20355:66"/>more art thou intangled with the cares &amp; pleaſures of this world, which vaniſh away like a ſhadow, and therefore may vvell be compared thereunto. They which hunt after honour, &amp; greedily ſeeke after riches, they for the moſt part neuer catch thys ſhadow, neither are they pertakers of their deſires, but followe after apparant deceits, and ſuch matters vvhich in time to come ſhall yeeld no helpe. Therefore the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, pſalm. 4. cryeth out; Why doe you ſeeke after vanitie, and followe after lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing?</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, the Sunne when it departeth from any coaſt or Country, leaueth the place cold, barren, and vnfruitfull, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe, when with his cheerefull beames he doth cherriſh the ground, all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to proſper and to bud forth: ſo when the ſunne of our righteouſnes, Chriſt our Lord, doth cheerfully ſhine into our harts and ſoules, with his heauenly and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table preſence, he maketh vs to bring forth good fruites, and ſuch good works as ſhall be acceptable vnto him. For his holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and grace where it lighteth, is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full fruitfull. And that hart of man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, which vvanteth the heate of Gods
<pb facs="tcp:20355:67"/>Spirit, cannot bring forth any worke to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life, the ſeed that is caſt into ſuch an vnprofitable ground, will com to nothing. When the King doth come to any towne, all things abound, and there is great plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, but when hee departeth, there are as many wants as there were before: ſo when Gods preſence doth reſt in our harts and ſoules, wee are prepared to euergy good worke, but when he is abſent, the doore is open to all vice and wickednes.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, as the Sunne when it ſhineth, doth comfort all creatures, and when it is gone, there is nothing elſe but darknes; ſo when GOD is preſent, we are cheerefull and ioyfull, and when he is abſent, wee are ſad and heauy. In the Land of Egipt there was moſt thicke darknes, that it might be felt, but in the land of Goſhen, where the Iſraelites were, there was light: So where the wicked are, there is nothing but dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; they ſit in darknes, and in the ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of death. They which forſake God, fall into the danger of the deuill, the prince of darkneſſe; and as farre as the heauen is from the earth, ſo great difference is there betwixt the grace of God, and our ſinfull diſpoſition.</p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:20355:67"/>
               <p>The fift and laſt inconuenience of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſeparated from God, is that when he is debarred of his mercy, he is preſently ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to his anger, and to his wrath. He that is fartheſt from Gods fauour, is neereſt to his puniſhment. As may bee ſeene in the prophet Ionas, who flying from God, was caſt into the ſea. He fled from God, when hee commanded him, and fell into his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, when he thought leaſt thereof. If thy ſonne fall ſicke at thy houſe, thou maiſt haue many helps to reſtore him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, but if he be ſicke in a ſtrange coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, hee is deſtitute of thy helpe, neyther canſt thou doe him any good. The farther we are from heauen, the more ſubiect are we to the danger of hell.</p>
               <p>A weake and frayle ſinner, although hee often fall, may be recouered, and the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie vvhich pertaine to GOD, and are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his gouernment, they fall not finallie, but riſe againe: but they which are paſt grace, which are hardned in wickedneſſe, and multiply ſinne, for the moſt part doe perriſh for euer. VVhereof there are tvvo notable examples recorded in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the one of Peter, the other of Iudas the traytour.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:20355:68"/>
               <p>Peter denied the Lord thrice, but becauſe he repented in hart, hee was not caſt away, but receaued vnto mercy. Pſal. 37.32. Pro. 24.15. But Iudas went far from God, and had rather be found among the enemies of Chriſt, then in his company. No mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell therefore though he died in his ſinnes, and becauſe hee went ſo farre aſtray, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did hee fall into ſo great miſchiefe, as afterward was apparant.</p>
               <p>If thou haſt gone away from the Lorde, endeuour all thou canſt to returne vnto him againe; which thou ſhalt moſt readily performe, if thou dooſt returne the ſame way thou wenteſt from him, Eph. 4. Caſt off lying, and ſpeake euery man truth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his neighbour; hee that hath ſtolne, let him ſteale no more, but rather labour, and worke with his handes, the thing which is good, that hee may haue to giue to him that needeth. Let the proude learne to bee humble, the drunkard to be ſober, the rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous to be chaſt, the miſers to be charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. If we haue gone away from God, let vs approch vnto him by a reformed lyfe, holy manners, &amp; holy conuerſation. That it may be ſpoken of vs, as Paule ſpeaketh of the Epheſians, chap. 2. Ye which were a
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:20355:68"/>farre of, are made neere. But more God-willing ſhall be ſaide heereof, when vvee ſhall ſpeake of the returne of the prodigall Sonne.</p>
               <p>Nowe let vs come to the third principall poynt,<note place="margin">3. What hee did in a ſtrange country.</note> namely, what the prodigall Sonne did in a ſtrange country, and how hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haued himſelfe, &amp; that was looſly enough, for hee ſpent his patrimony riotouſly and waſtfully. When this youngſter had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued his patrimony, he was ſo prickt vp in pride, that hee thought himſelfe a Lord or a King, to doe what him liſted, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade he muſt to ſhewe his brauery. His Fathers houſe could not holde him, his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious will and looſe liberty ſet him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, the deuill beeing at his elbow to tell him what a iolly fellow hee was; and the deuils workmen, euill companions, ſet this matter abroach, to bring him &amp; his eſtate, rather to confuſion then to perfection, to woe then to happines. And now this ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull game begins, and his ſhame is ſet out to euery mans view, for he conſumed all his goods among harlots.</p>
               <p>And there he waſted his goods with rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous liuing.]<note place="margin">Waſted all.</note> Hauing receaued his porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, hee ſets not himſelfe to liue vnder anie
<pb facs="tcp:20355:69"/>ciuill gouernment, neither doth hee in any ſort regard his credite, but as an outlaw, an abiect, and an extrauagant, and a wilfull waſter, ſets all at ſixe and ſeauen, hee and his companions being like to the graſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of Egypt, that eate vp euery greene thing.</p>
               <p>Firſt hee ſpent all, and ſecondly among harlots in riotous liuing. Many a one through pouerty ſpendeth all, &amp; ſome by debt ouerthrowe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues; ſome through ſuretiſhip are vndone, ſome are ouerſhot by ſutes of law, ſome through ſicknes and phiſicke are brought to a low ebbe: ſome by fire are made full poore, ſome through ſhipwracke are caſt behinde hand, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers are the inconueniences that fall out in the worlde, whereby a mans eſtate may be brought to nothing. But none of all theſe hinderances come through wilfulnes, for the man that feareth god, may be brought to all theſe hazards: but the vngodly vva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter hath no defence for himſelfe.</p>
               <p>By this departing from GOD, ſee howe the wretched ſinner looſeth all that he receaued, which was very profitable for him, to the attayning of euerlaſting lyfe: As knowledge, vnderſtanding and grace:
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:20355:69"/>yea, hee ſpoyleth both his body and ſoule in this life, and in another. All the good deedes which hee hath doone in this lyfe, are by this meanes defaced, as though hee had doone no ſuch thing. According to that we read, Ezech. 18.24. If the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous turne away from his righteouſneſſe, &amp; commit iniquity, and doe according to all the abhominations that the wicked man doth, ſhalle he liue? All his righteouſneſſe that he hath done, ſhall not be mentioned, but in his tranſgreſſion that he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and in his ſin that hee hath ſinned, in them ſhall he die.</p>
               <p>Tell me if one abyding among the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans for the ſpace of twenty or thirty yeres, &amp; after returning into Spaine loaded with wealth, forgetting all his former labours and dangers, which hee vndertooke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee coulde come to that treaſure, ſhoulde wilfully in one night hazzard all at the dice or cardes, vvould not euery one in his company, iudge him not to be well in his wits? But the careleſſe ſinner is farre more fooliſh, vvho running into mortall ſinne, dooth ouer-throwe the fruites of a godly life, 30. or 40. yeeres ſpent in prayer and faſting &amp; almes, &amp; many other godlie
<pb facs="tcp:20355:70"/>exerciſes, and indangering the hope of a better life. Hee for a ſhort delight, and by greedy couetouſnes to gaine, looſeth all in a night what hee hath gotten a long while, yet thou dooing the like betwixt God &amp; thy ſelfe, art far more fooliſh. For he may returne to the Indians, and gette as much more, but the ſinner cannot doe ſo, for the moſt part rather making himſelfe the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant of ſin, then ſeeking to breake of the courſe thereof, &amp; as the ſeruant laboureth for the Maiſter, ſo the ſinner maketh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a bond-ſlaue to the deuill, being alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether vnable to practiſe any worke to the obtayning of life euerlaſting. Firſt thou dooſt looſe all thy good deeds which thou haſt done: and ſecondly, thou dooſt bring thy ſelfe into that eſtate, from the vvhich thou canſt not eaſily recouer thy ſelfe, and therefore none more vnhappy, none more vnwiſe.</p>
               <p>But howe did this prodigall ſonne waſt and conſume all his goods?<note place="margin">With rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous liuing.</note> With riotous and licentious liuing, among varlets and whores. Which often falleth out among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that are negligently brought vp, who when they are come to yeres of diſcretion, care neither for parents, nor maiſters, nor
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:20355:70"/>Magiſtrates, nor theyr betters, thinking themſelues equall to all, and inferiour to none. They deſpiſe both the counſell and the company of thoſe that bee good and godly, in gaming &amp; banquetting they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede, ſpending that moſt careleſly and lewdly, which their parents gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with carke and care.</p>
               <p>This prodigall child waſted all in wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonnes and whoring,<note place="margin">Whoredom</note> which vice conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the gold of grace, and the power and ſtrength of nature; weakening the bodie, diſturbing reaſon, making the wit &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding very dull, ſpoyling vs of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, honour, of temporall benefits &amp; bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, and of eternall happines, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vs vnto vtter ouerthrow &amp; confuſion. Therefore Salomon ſaith, hee that nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth a whore, waſteth his ſubſtance. Pro. 29.3. and he that loueth feaſting, ſhall die a begger. Therefore it is compared vnto fire that deuoureth all, waſting our welth, conſuming the body, and deſtroying the ſoule. This ſinne prouoked GOD to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the world with water, &amp; to conſume Sodome, and other Citties thereto adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with fire and brimſtone. The Siche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites and Beniamites for this, were put to
<pb facs="tcp:20355:71"/>the ſword. Abſolon killed his brother Ammon at a banquet, for defiling his ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. Through this Salomon was driuen to idolatry, Sampſon loſt his eyes with ſhame and diſcredite, Dauid felt the ſmart heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, his children committing inceſt &amp; mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to his great griefe to heare of it. Thys cauſed the two wicked Iudges to bee ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to death, and for this offence there fel in one day 23. thouſand of the people of Iſraell. VVhereby wee may gather howe great this ſin is, that had ſo great puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and whereof in the Scripture there are ſo many fearefull examples. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſt ſuffered many ſinnes among his diſciples, but not this. He bore with the vnbeleefe of Thomas and of the reſt, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered theyr pride and ambition, when they ſtroue who ſhould be the greateſt; when they called for fire from heauen, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſume the Samaritans, and to be reuenged of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, hee gently reproued them. When they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uied at others, for caſting out deuils in his Name, he did not ſo greatly rebuke them. The couetouſnes of Iudas, nay his treaſon, Chriſt did freendly forwarne him of. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter denied him, and forſwore him, and yet he reſtored him.</p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:20355:71"/>
               <p>The beaſtlines of luſt, he which feedeth among the Lillies could neuer abide in his company. And therefore his loue was eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially bent vnto the Euangeliſt Saint Iohn, for his purity and virginitie. Hee is the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant of the deuill, whoſe minde doth one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly runne vpon beaſtly cogitations. And the Apoſtle, Gala. <hi>5.</hi> doth pronounce of them, that they that are ſo carried away, ſhall neuer enter into the kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. This ſinne is the fire of hell, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whereof is gluttony, filthines the flame, ſhame the ſmoake that aſcendeth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hence, and euerlaſting torments the ende and the reward thereof.</p>
               <p>VVhen the deuill tempted our Sauiour Chriſt, hee did not once offer to intangle him by this meanes, knowing how farre it was from his nature; and how much he did deteſt it, the deuill was not ſo groſſe, but he aſſaulted him with finer conceits. Thys ſin deſtroyeth the body, ſhortneth the life, defaceth vertue, and is the manifeſt breach of Gods lawe. All other ſinnes defile the ſoule, but this defileth both ſoule &amp; bodie. Your bodies are the temple of God, and hee that defileth the temple of God, him ſhall God deſtroy. 1. Cor. 6.</p>

               <p>Thou canſt not auoyde Gods ſeuere iudgement, if thou dooſt impudentlie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe the Temple of God. But nowe thys curſed plague hath ſpredde it ſelfe ouer all the worlde. Lots daughters are counted moſt infamous, but I feare mee there are ſome which are more woorthy of ſhame, which in the ſight of the worlde are coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted chaſt. They required onely to preſerue ſeede of theyr Father, but many wiues fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low luſt too greedily, more then to haue children; beſide, many other ſhameful be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiours vnknowne to the world, wherof their conſcience no doubt doth accuſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Let them call for mercy and forgiueneſſe, and endeuour chaſtity, without the which none ſhall ſee God. The female among beaſts hauing conceaued, doe neuer ſuffer the male to come neere them: Thus the vnreaſonable creatures teach vs, that make great account of Chriſtianitie, to be ſober, temperate, and chaſt. God forbid that all ſhould ſo be affected; and they that are ſo ouertaken may learne to amend for ſhame of themſelues, and feare of eternal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>This ſin is ouer-come by flying from it,<note place="margin">Remedies of luſt.</note> as the Apoſtle counſelleth. 1. Corin. 6.18.
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:20355:72"/>Fly fornication.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>  All other ſinnes are ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by fighting, this only by flying. It is not good to fight with that enemy which taketh ſtrength by thy preſence. Howe ſhall that King fight with his enemie, that hath traytours in his army? And when we fight againſt riot &amp; whoredome, our own body and ſinfull fleſh is ready to take part againſt vs. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Another remedy of thys ſin is, the remembrance of hel fire, wherein lewd perſons ſhall bee tormented. It is a harde thing to reſiſt thy tentation, but more hard to endure hell torments. But as the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fire ouercommeth the leſſer, ſo let hell fire put out the flame of fleſhly luſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> A third remedy is repentance, with a ful and reſolute endeuour of all amendment. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> A fourth remedy is the practiſe of al good workes, walking in an honeſt vocation, preyer, and faſting. Fire is quenched by water, &amp; by humble teares, all fleſhlie luſts are waſhed and wiped away. This ſinne (as all other ſinnes) is not in our power to refraine or ouercome: the Lord therefore giue vs his grace, and of his goodnes alter the power of our wicked nature. And that wee cannot doe, the Lorde will bring to paſſe in our behalfe, if wee earneſtly ſeeke
<pb facs="tcp:20355:73"/>his helpe by prayer, and that comfort and ſtrength which Paul had, the ſame ſhal we haue; My grace is ſufficient for thee. To theſe helps may other alſo bee added, to keepe our ſelues as much as may be, out of the companie of Women, according to that verſe, <hi>Carpit enim vires paulatim vrit<expan>

               <p>And this is it which the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of, 1. Cor. 9.27. I beate downe my bodie, and bring it into ſubiection.</p>
               <p>By this prodigall ſonne wee are taught, into how great miſery, a fooliſh and ſelfe-willed man or woman is brought vnto, by following their owne vnbrideled will. He was wealthy, ſounde, and in eſpeciall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in his fathers houſe, but euery one ſeeth into howe great pouerty and miſerie hee is brought; in following his owne ſwinge and ſway, hee loſt all that euer hee had, and of a wealthy man and in high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, became moſt vnhappy and of baſe account; being pinched with pouerty for his aboundance, hauing rags for his robes, and beeing inforced to eate huskes vvith
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:20355:73"/>Swine, which before could away with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but delicates and dainties. VVe ſee alſo vvhat is his reward which forſaketh the Lord; as alſo what his practiſe is that is left vnto himſelfe, becomming worſe &amp; worſe, and falling from one ſin into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Marke alſo howe the number of ſins increaſe daily, vntill they haue altogether ouer-whelmed vs. We learne alſo vvhat a horrible iudgement and miſerable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion remaineth to him whom GOD gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth ouer, and vvho is thus left to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. On the contrary, what a great ioy &amp; comfort it is, to be vnder Gods direction and tuition, the which onely keepeth vs from ſinne, from danger, and from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall death.</p>
               <p>They that are not vnder Gods guiding, and vnder his ſafegarde, howe great are theyr miſeries? and into howe manie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conueniences doe they fall, howe manie miſchiefes and calamities doe light vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them. Thys prodigall Sonne loſt all, ſpent his goods riotouſlie among harlots, and beeing driuen to great pouertie, was almoſt ſtarued to death by famine. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> And heere-hence followeth the fourth mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter worthie of noting and remembrance,
<pb facs="tcp:20355:74"/>to wit, what enſued in thoſe daies, after he had ſpent all. There followed a famine &amp; miſerable ſcarcetie.</p>
               <p>Now when he had ſpent all, there aroſe a great dearth throughout the Land,<note place="margin">Now. &amp;c.</note> and hee began to bee in neceſſitie.] This is the end of riotous &amp; maiſterfull youth, which quickly conſume all and come vnto great miſeries, if not lamentable ends. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it is the duty of the parents, to bring vp theyr chyldren in the inſtruction &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the Lord, Ephe. 6.4. And if their education proue well, and their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren bee of good gouernment, ſo much they haue got and gained, as alſo they, are to giue GOD thankes that hath giuen ſo good ſucceſſe. But if the contrary fall out, this croſſe and affliction is patiently to bee indured, and the parents are in the meane time to content and comfort themſelues, that in dooing theyr beſt endeuour, they haue diſcharged theyr dutie. Ezech. 3.19. For often times it falls out, not onely to ſlothfull and negligent parents, but alſo to thoſe that are moſt watchfull &amp; carefull, that they may haue chyldren wicked and vngodly, farre differing from the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the parents. And the more worthy
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:20355:74"/>and godly the Parents are, the more are they vexed with this affliction, as Adam had Caine, and Noe had Cham, &amp; Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham had Iſmaell, and Iſaac had Eſau, and Dauid had Abſolon &amp; Ammon, Eh had Hophni and Phinehas, and Samuell had ſonnes giuen to corruption and bribery, all which did greatly diſgrace theyr Fathers houſes, ſtocke and linage.</p>
               <p>In this prodigall Sonne, although hee were ſo forgone, yet God doth not vtterly forſake him, but reacheth him out the hand of mercy, &amp; ſheweth him the means of repentance. Firſt, in ſetting before his eyes his pouerty and miſery, and then pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching him with famine, that by his rods &amp; chaſtiſements, he might draw him to new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and amendement: Oſe, 2.9. And worthily hee began to want, to whom the treaſure of knowledge and wiſedome, and of the feare of God, did ſeeme a matter ſo baſe, preferring his own pleaſures, and the vanities of the world before it, &amp; who had forſaken the high eſtimation of heauenlie wealth. Hee that leaueth the well-ſpring, muſt needes thirſt, and hee that departeth from treaſure, muſt needs want, &amp; he that emptieth himſelfe of honeſtie &amp; goodnes,
<pb facs="tcp:20355:75"/>muſt needes come to nothing. Hee began to want &amp; ſuffer hunger, becauſe nothing can ſatiſ-fie a prodigall minde: and hee is woorthy to bee famiſhed which will not feede of heauenly foode. Where-ſoeuer Ioſeph went there was plenty, and where he was not, there was ſcarcety enough. So where God is, there is no want, and where his helping hand is not, it is no maruell though all come to hauock &amp; ruine.</p>
               <p>Three things are heere woorthy to be conſidered. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, that without God thereis nothing but famine and penury.  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that nothing can ſatiſ-fie our ſoules but God. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, how in God onely, &amp; not elſe-where, men &amp; all other creatures, finde all plenty and aboundance. Pſal. 34. The Lyons want <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>d ſuffer hunger, but they that feare the Lord, want no manner of thing that is good. pſal. 23. The Lorde is my Shepheard, therefore can I lacke no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. And there is no Prince nor Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate in the worlde that can ſay ſo. For the greater theyr eſtate, the greater theyr ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences, and vpon infinite expences come great wants. Onely the godly mind, which hueth in a contented eſtate, hath this ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiencie.
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:20355:75"/>The ſheepe ouer who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the deuill is ſhepheard, haue noyſome hearbes to feede on, and venomous water to drinke, which ſecretly infect vnto death. For ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours pleaſures and riches bring deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the ſoule of a ſinner, they deceiue vs of eternall life, and keepe vs farre from it.</p>
               <p>He that is ſicke of the Dropſie is ſtill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thirſt, and wealth and pleaſure ſtill call for more. pſal. 145.15. The eyes of all waite vpon thee, ô Lord, and thou giueſt them theyr meate in due ſeaſon. Coniurers can ſette aboundance of dainty <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eates before thine eyes, but if thou touch to taſt, there is nothing but onely the deceit of the eyes, which for a time they can wonderfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude. So the deceauable worlde, can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade her followers. that all her gyfts are of great waight, and that they are ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to ſatiſ-fie our deſire to the vttermoſt, but in the end they prooue to bee vaine, more vnconſtant then the wind, and ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then vanitie it ſelfe. And this is a moſt true cauſe, why ſinners can neuer bee ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſ-fied and finde them-ſelues contented. Hee that is a Husbandman, woulde be a gentleman, a gentleman a ſquire, a ſquire
<pb facs="tcp:20355:76"/>a Knight, a Knight a Lorde, a Lorde an Earle. So are all the deſires of the world, they ſtirre vp hunger, but they neuer ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſ-fie hunger, or quench thirſt. Therefore the prophet truly ſpeaketh of ſuch: Yee haue eaten, and haue not enough, ye haue drunke and are thirſtie, ye clothe you, and are not warme, he that earneth wages, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the wages into a broken bagge. The water that was poured about the Altar, was burnt vp. 1. Reg. 18.

                  </gap>hat dooth conſume them. The more thou haſt of this worlds goods, the more doth the fire of thy deſire breake forth into a flame, as if thou ſhouldeſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour to put out fire with oyle.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, nothing can ſatiſ-fie our mindes but God, as the prodigall Sonne was neuer quiet in mind, vntill he returned vnto his Fathers houſe. There is no ioy or perfection but in God. As God ſpeaketh by the mouth of the prophet, pſalme. 81. Open thy mouth wide, and I ſhall fill it. After that God did commaund vnto the people, the keeping of his commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he willeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ope<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:20355:76"/>wide, &amp; he will fill it. Which is not meant of the mouth of the body, which a little may fill, but of the contentation of the ſoule, which is not eaſily ſatisfied. The ſoule beeing made to the image of God, muſt then be in his beſt perfection, when God doth begin to renue it. In God onely is ſufficiency, reſt, quietneſſe, and perfect ioy: without GOD there is nothing but greefe and perplexity of minde, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth and multiplyeth, while wee make that account of the world as wee doe, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king our reſt and chiefeſt ſolace therein. That veſſell which is put into the vvater, is very light, but being taken out, is very hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie: So, ſo long as thy minde doth reſt in God, all thinges are comfortable and ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, but when it is plunged in worldly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, all things ſeeme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>The vngodly beeing weary in ſeruing the worlde, are moſt comberſome vnto themſelues, hauing a clogged ſoule, and a heauy conſcience.

The bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die can take no reſt beeing ſtraitned in a narrow roome, and all the worlds delights are too ſtrait for a godly ſoule, for it deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to bee inlarged with that freedome which commeth from God, euen as the byrde which is fed with daintie meate in a cage, makes more account of further li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, although hee be deſtitute of dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
               <p>Moſes beeing in Pharaos Court, could not ſo well ſerue God, as when hee vvas quite cleere from it. Seeing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there is no reſt in theſe worldly matters, turne vnto God, and make a better choyce, &amp; a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier change. When God made man, hee reſted from all the workes which hee had made, ſo did he not reſt whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had made other creatures: Seeing therefore GOD reſted in making man, let mans chiefeſt happines be in reſting in God.</p>
               <p>God filleth our deſires with goodneſſe, ſaith the Prophet, neyther is our appetite ſatiſ-fied vntill it enioy that vviſhed end. For our ſoule is of ſo noble a diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that it can finde reſt no where but in

Therefore the holy king and prophet ſayth, Euen as the Hart deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the water brookes, ſo longeth my ſoule after thee, ô God. My ſoule is a thirſt for God, yea euen for the liuing GOD, when ſhall I come before the preſence of God.

               <p>Hetherto we haue ſhewed, how that in the world there is nothing but famine and great ſcarcetie, and penury of all thinges; but in God onely there is perfect ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie, ioy and glorie to be ſounde. Nowe let vs ſee a further reaſon of theſe thinges afore-ſayde, and vvhy in the vvorlde is
<pb facs="tcp:20355:81"/>ſcarcely, and all plenty with God, which is the third thing to be ſpoken of. The world is not ſufficient, becauſe the large and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple capacitie of our mindes dooth further extend it ſelfe. The ſoule which was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for God, what-ſoeuer is inferiour to God, it counteth it but baſe. The pottle or the gallon, cannot bee filled with the meaſure of a pynt, &amp; all the worlds goods, is but as a graine of muſtard ſeede in the belly of an Elephant; they fill the ſoule &amp; ſatisfie the minde in ſuch ſort, that ſtil there is ſome place empty, ſo vaine they are and fall of ſound (as empty veſſels haue a great ſound) &amp; in theſe deſires there is no ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, no perfection.</p>
               <p>Againe, the deſires of the ſoule are infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, the profits &amp; pleaſures of this world haue their bounds. So that there is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther remedy for vs in this life, but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue our mindes from the deſire of theſe earthly things, and to tranſport them vnto God, and heauenly conſiderations, that ſo our mindes and our deſires may fully be contented. For all other creatures GOD hath appoynted theyr foode, but God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is the foode of the ſoule. As graſſe for the Lyon, &amp; fleſh for the horſe is vnmeete
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:20355:81"/>foode, becauſe they are not agreeable to theyr nature, ſo ought not earthly deſires to be the foode of the ſoule. For there is nothing in the worlde to ſerue the minde, but onely God. Pryde, and couetouſnes, and enuy, and pleaſure, are the things that mens mindes doe moſt ayme at, but theſe are rather the famine then the foode of the ſoule. The grace of God, and the heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gyfts of his holy Spirit, they onely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and nouriſh the ſoule, and ſtrong then it. Why is breade rather the nouriſhment of mans body then poyſon? The reaſon is becauſe the one is agreeable to the nature of man, the other dooth deſtroy it. So is GOD the foode of the ſoule, becauſe his preſence and goodneſſe is moſt agreeable there-vnto, beeing created after the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of God; as for all other matters, they are nothing elſe but death and famiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And if thou feede the ſoule vvith any earthly conſiderations, it is as if thou ſhouldeſt feede the body with ſtones and grauell. As our ſoule without God begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to be ſad, heauy, hungry and dead, ſo all the delights; pleaſures, profits, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of this worlde, are nothing but miſery &amp; pouerty. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> The fiſt generall matter

               <p>I haue finned;] hee humbly confeſſeth his fault, neither dooth he excuſe himſelfe,

               <p>Father, I haue ſinned,] not as other men, but my ſins are more then the haires of my head. I haue finned againſt heauen, as the prophet calleth the heauen and the earth to witnes againſt the Iſraelites. I will not go about to cleere my ſelfe, but I will plainely confeſle that I am vnwoorthy of all fauour. Theſe thoughts came not vnto him by the courſe of his naturall wit, and worldly reaſon, but through the grace of
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:20355:97"/>God, which altered his minde, and by the force of faith, which made him mount a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all earthly conſiderations. For if hee had followed his owne naturall reaſon, he woulde haue ſaide, I did not vnderſtand wherein I offended, neyther haue I done theſe things of ſet purpoſe, but fooliſhlie was I led away through ill company and bad counſell, and therefore there is cauſe why I ſhould be pardoned. Which courſe of he had followed, he might rather haue prouoked his Fathers diſpleaſure, then drawne him vnto mercy. Before an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Iudge our confeſſion dooth condemne vs, but before God it is the meanes to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure our ſaluation. The Lord ſaith, Ezech. 18 My wayes are not as your wayes, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are my thoughts as your thoughts. Dauid, Manaſſes, Mary Magdalen, Peter the publican, and the thiefe, did humbly confeſſe, that theyr offences were greater then theyr puniſhment and therefore they obtained mercy, whereof Caine &amp; Saule, and Achab, and other miſſed, becauſe proudly and not humbly, they asked gods mercy.</p>
               <p>I haue ſinned againſt heauen,] becauſe I haue made more account of earthly and

I wil praiſe the lord alwaies, ſaith the prophet, pſal. 33. and my mouth ſhalbe ful of his praiſe. Man throgh ſin is dumbe, and cannot prayſe God.</p>
               <p>I haue finned before thee,] that is in the inward receit of my ſoule, where-into no mans eyes can pierce, but onely God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue, &amp; many &amp; more hainous are our of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are openly known to the world.

               <p>I haue finned before thee,] ô Lord my God, what ſmall account haue I made of thee, howe little haue I regarded thee, I ſhoulde haue conſidered that thou didſt looke vpon me, &amp; behold my doings, that althogh I was much &amp; long prouoked by my ſinful fleſh, yet the remembrance of thy preſence, authority, &amp; ſcuerity in puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhould haue reſtrained mee. Is God blind, that he cannot ſee our offences. pſal. 94.9. Eccl. 23.18. He. 4.13. nay our blindnes is lamentable, which cannot ſee our blindnes is lamentable, which cannot ſee our owne miſery, vntill it be almoſt paſt remedy, and we in a maner brought to deſpaire, as our firſt parents in paradice, and Iudas after he had betrayed Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The wicked Iudges that woulde haue defiled Suſanna, woulde not behold hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. Although ſinners beleeue that God knoweth all, yet they ſuſpect that he is not offended with their ſins, or els they flatter
<pb facs="tcp:20355:99"/>themſelues, thinking that they ſhall eſcape ſcotfree, becauſe GOD dooth forbeare to puniſh them. The forbearing of GOD, which ſhould prouoke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to repentance, dooth harden them in theyr ſines. That the eyes of God cannot be blinded, let vs heare what the Word of God doth ſay to this intent, 1. Sam. 16. GOD ſeeth not as man ſeeth, for man looketh on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance, but God beholdeth the hart. pſalm. 7. The righteous God tryeth the very harts and raines. He fitly &amp; aptly ſaith, that God ſearcheth, for the ſmalleſt things that are, cannot eſcape his ſight, he ſearcheth diligently, as it is ſaid of the vvo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that ſwept her houſe &amp; lighted a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, to finde her Ioſt groate. The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God diueth into the bottome of the great deepe, Ecclus. 24. ſo that, that which neuer man ſawe, is manifeſt vnto him. Let no man think his ſinne to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne, neither let him ſay with the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Iudges, The Orchard doores are ſhut, and no man ſeeth vs. The Iudge of all the world ſeeth thee, before whoſe iudgement ſeate thou ſhalt ſtand. Many are like the fooliſh beaſt, which hauing his head hid, thinketh all his body hid to. Although we
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:20355:99"/>ſee not God, ye God ſeeth vs, &amp; is about our paths God willed Ezech. chap. 8. to dig through the hole of the wall, that hee might ſee the abhominations of the houſe of Iſraell. Then he ſaid vnto me, ſonne of man, haſt thou ſeene what the auncients of the houſe of Iſraell doe in the dark, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one in the chamber of his imagery? for they ſay, The Lord ſeeth vs not, the Lord hath forſaken the earth.</p>
               <p>I haue ſinned before thee,] ſo impudent and ſhameleſſe was I, &amp; like a beaſt before thee, neither co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidering thy ſecrete know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, nor fearing the power of thy mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold puniſhments, for diuers are the waies which thou vſeſt to puniſh offenders. I haue finned before thee, for thou onelie knoweſt my ſecrets. Man doth not ſee the hainouſnes of his ſinnes, till God do open his eyes. The deuill blinded our firſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents eyes, to make them beleeue they were gods: but when God opened theyr eyes, they appeared to themſelues to bee moſt miſerable creatures, and to be aſhamed of themſelues, and their own nakedneſſe.</p>
               <p>I haue ſinned;] plenty made him wilde and vnciuill, and like to a brute beaſt that hath no vnderſtanding, beeing altogether
<pb facs="tcp:20355:100"/>diſobedient and vnruly, therefore came this miſdry wel vpon him, as a fit meane to bring him to repentance. So fit it is, that God by great extreamities, ſhould violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie breake our vnrulie nature, and that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries and deſpaire ſhoulde pull vs downe vppon our knees, whom no other reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die can tame.

               <p>Thys tenor and forme of ſpeaking vnto his Father, no eloquence or art of Retho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke had put into thys young mans mind, but his owne conſcience, beeing greeued and diſpleaſed with it ſelfe; and yet not vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly conceauing an extreame ill opinion of his Fathers goodnes. For Gods mercie is not truly receaued, till harty repentance become an humble ſuter, which hath all his ground, of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort in the hope of Gods mercy.

So that prudent woman Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaell, knowing that Dauid requeſted her to wife, 1.

And for this humble co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſion Chriſt praiſed the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turions faith, &amp; granted his requeſt. Luke, 7.8.9.</p>

All our life is paſſed in good deſires, we purpoſe to ariſe, and yet wee neuer doe ariſe, that is, wee neuer ſettle our ſelues to performe good works, which are the fruits of true repentance,<note place="margin">Repentance.</note> and of a liuely fayth.

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:20355:101"/>to moue thee much, to make haſt to turne vnto the Lord, becauſe many are dead and gone, which purpoſed well, &amp; neuer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, had in their mindes to turne vnto the Lord, and yet neuer conuerted. This delay hath deceaued many, and the ſinner that promiſeth himſelfe long life, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth ſhort thereof, taking vpon him to diſpoſe of the time to come, which onely belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vnto God. Iam. 4.14. Thou knoweſt not what ſhall be to morrow. It is not for you to know the times, and ſeaſons, (ſayth Chriſt to his diſciples) vvhich the Father hath put in his owne power. Acts. 1.7. In the time of Noe, God cut of twenty yeres of thoſe yeres, which he had graunted vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, that they might repent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they would not make vſe of the time that God graunted. And if GOD did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge the time which hee had promiſed vnto ſinners, becauſe they woulde not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repent, what will he do to them, to whom he hath made no promiſe of any time. Yea although thou didſt know, thou ſhouldſt liue long, yet oughteſt thou ſpeedily to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent. For then is thy repentance more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God, when thou dooſt offer it in the prime of thy youth, &amp; in the flower
<pb facs="tcp:20355:102"/>of thy age. But they which delay the time to theyr decayed age, may feare leaſt they drinke vp the dregs of Gods wrath. The beſt of our tyme we offer vnto the world, and the worſt to GOD: vvhen as thoſe things we offer vnto God, ought to be the choyſeſt, and of chiefeſt account. Deu. 15.21. In the ſacrifices of the Lord, they were commaunded to offer a male of a yeere old, without ſpot or blemiſh. Mal. 1. They that offered the blind and the lame, were reprooued: Offer it nowe to thy Prince, ſaith the Lord, will he be contented there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.</p>
               <p>But why doſt thou beſtow thy beſt time vpon the worlde, and the baſeſt tyme to God? How fooliſh were hee that were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt drowned, and ſhoulde refuſe or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay to haue help. Late repentance is ſildom true and ſound, but rather inforced and counterfet. The rich man in the goſpell, would haue repented, but it was too late for himſelfe, and therefore he ſpake for his fiue brethren. So thouſands after death, ſhall bewaile the time that they loſt in their life, and did not repent, and nowe would, but it is to no purpoſe.</p>
               <p>This prodigall Sonne, conſidering his
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:20355:102"/>miſerable eſtate by ſinne, and from howe great dignitie of Gods grace, he was falne, purpoſed to leaue the bewitching loue of ſinne, and to turne vnto the Lord, vvhich as he truly intended, ſo faithfully did hee fulfill it: and he roſe, and came to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The ſame oughteſt thou to doe, and to riſe from thy manifolde offences, not delaying vntill to morrowe, for thou knovveſt not vvhether thou ſhalt liue ſo long.</p>
               <p>He came not to God of his own mind, but by his ſpeciall grace hee was directed there-vnto. The eſpeciall helpe vvhich, GOD offereth vnto a ſinner, to further him in the vvorke of repentance, is of two ſorts. Some before,<note place="margin">Howe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is wrought.</note> inuiting vs to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, ſome followe, and are inſeprably ioyned there-vnto. Of the former ſort, are Preachers, Sermons, holy inſpirations, exhortations, and counſels of friendes, the feare of hell-fire, the hope of euerlaſting life, afflictions, miracles, examples of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and the like. For by all theſe meanes, God doth forcibly draw, &amp; mercifully al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure ſinners vnto repentance. Theſe helps, of many are called vneffectuall helpes, not but that they are ſufficient to turne
<pb facs="tcp:20355:103"/>the harts of wicked ſinners, or at leaſt to leaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> without excuſe, but being made voyd by the ſtubborne and obſtinat mind of ſinners, who continue in ſin, with a ſtiffe purpoſe, thoſe helps want their happy ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe. Of the latter ſort are the continuall good motions of Gods Spirit, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer leaue vs, vntill in ſecrete ſort they haue tamed our rebellious will, while the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of God, after a moſt louing and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull affection, doth make vs pliable to his will. So that now wee ſhed aboundance of teares, and are moſt willing and deſirous, to alter the euill courſe of life, &amp; to frame our ſelues to all godly wayes. Theſe helps are called moſt effectuall, beeing ioyned with the worke of repentance, ſo inſepra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, that without theſe it cannot be, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can theſe helps be made voyde, ſeeing god himſelfe doth make them moſt forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Although theſe latter helps are moſt neceſſary, and that the former haue no force without theſe, yet the firſt are migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty perſwaſions, and moſt auailable induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for the ſtubborne mindes of men, are not wonne without manifolde occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and inforcements. This prodigal Son, had the former helps, as affliction; pouerty,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:20355:103"/>famine, and miſery, which did allure and exhort him, to lay aſide his ſinfull life, and to turne vnto God. GOD alſo put in his head, the reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance of his fathers houſe, that calling to minde his former happines, from whence he was falne, he might with a moſt earneſt deſire, ſeeke to recouer the ſame againe God granted him the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of himſelfe, and oponed his mind to behold his miſery, wherby he was brought the more ſpeedily to returne. Whereby he gathered his wits together, and ſtirred up himſelfe, and roſe and came to his father.</p>
               <p>It is to be noted, that there be diuers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees to turne vnto God. Firſt hee calleth himſelfe to remembrance, then hee doth accuſe and condemne himſelfe for that ſin and wickednes, whereunto hee ſeeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſo much giuen and ſo head-long car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away. Thus did this prodigall Sonne returne, beholding the miſerable eſtate,<note place="margin">The degrees of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</note> whereinto he was falne, through his owne wilful will. This is that where-vnto the prophet Eſay exhorteth, chapter 46. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member this and be aſhamed, brings it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to minde; O you tranſgreſſers, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the former things of old. So Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, chap. 18.11. Returne you euery one

               <p n="8">The eyght matter worthy of our conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration in this parable is, the infinite mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of God, which is not ouercome by the multitude of our ſinnes, to remoue all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire, vvhere-into we are moſt eaſily rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to fall.</p>
               <p>Behold a patterne of the gracious mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifulneſſe of God, who hauing iuſt cauſe to be angry, yet when he ſaw this loſt ſon, turned his anger into pitty and compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

               <p>God dooth not looke when wee will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne vnto him, but rather doth preuent vs with his mercy and grace. Therefore it is no doubt, but that when wee doe repent, GOD dooth receiue vs into his fauour, And if men, which by nature are deſirous of reuenge, &amp; which ſtand too much vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon theyr owne authoritie, yet through a fatherly kinde of affection, forgiue, the great offences of theyr ſonnes, yea, of theyr owne accord, vvill endeuour to ſeeke after them, ſhall wee thinke that God is, or will be more hard to vs, whoſe goodnes is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, &amp; which far ſurpaſſeth all the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes that an earthly father can ſhew. Eſa. 65.24. Before they cry, I wil heare them. pſal. 32.5. I ſaide I will confeſſe vnto the Lord my vnrighteouſnes, &amp; thou forgaueſt the iniquitie of my ſinne.</p>
               <p>It is the mercy of the Lord, that wee are not vtterly conſumed, as the prophet Iere.
<pb facs="tcp:20355:105"/>ſpeaketh. When he was a farre of; that is, when he firſt purpoſed to return vnto the Lord. So ſoone as hee had a minde to be made whole, euen before hee made his moane vnto Chriſt, or knew what Chriſt was, this moſt louing and gentle Father, friend and Sauiour, made him whole, and bad him ſin no more, leaſt a worſe thing might befall him. And here is fulfilled that which God ſpeaketh by the prophet Eſay, chap. 65. It ſhall be that ere euer they call, I ſhall aunſwere them, and while they are yet but thinking howe to ſpeake, I ſhall heare them. He did behold him as Dauid deſired, pſalm. 25.17. Looke vpon mine aduerſitie and miſery, and forgiue mee all my ſin.</p>
               <p>God hath great care ouer the godly, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen when they goe aſtray from him, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dooth he ſtraight-way caſt them off. The prodigall ſonne coulde not returne, nor once conceiue ſo holy a deſire, vnleſſe God had looked vppon him, with a moſt gracious aſpect. 2. Cor. 3.5. The image repreſented in the glaſſe, cannot lift vp the eyes, vnleſſe he whoſe image it is, doe firſt looke vp. Therefore that thou muſt lyft vp thy eyes to heauen, thou hadſt neede
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:20355:105"/>that God, whoſe image thou art, ſhoulde firſt looke down vpon thee from heauen, and caſt the eyes of his mercy vppon thee, that thereby thou maiſt be drawne to lyft vp the eyes of thy minde, to him that loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vpon thee. For vnleſſe hee doe firſt, by a ſpeciall influence looke vppon thee, thou canſt neyther looke vpon him, nor be conuerted vnto him. Thou canſt not riſe and goe vnto him, vnleſſe he mooue thee, and leade thee, or inforce and drawe thee. As our Sauiour ſaith; No man commeth vnto me, vnleſſe my heauenly father draw him. Ioh. 6.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, the ſpouſe in the Canticles, acknowledging his ſecret power, &amp; moſt friendly operation, prayeth ſaying, chap. 1. Draw mee after thee, wee will runne after the ſauour of thy ſweet oyniments. If thou dooſt not draw mee, I cannot come after thee. So the prophet Eze. chap. 2.2. When God commaunded him to ſtand vpon his feete, the ſpirit entred into him, &amp; ſet him vpon his feete, for vnleſſe the Spirit of the Lord had holpen him, hee could not haue flood by himſelfe. Lam. 5.21. Turn thou vs vnto thee, ô Lord, and we ſhall be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. So fiſt he be held Peter, and after he
<pb facs="tcp:20355:106"/>wept bitterly. The pſal. 104. ſpeaketh of God, ver. 32. The earth ſhal tremble at the looke of him, if he doe but touch the hills, they ſhall ſmoake. This is he which bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the loſt ſheep into his fold, who onely doth heale our infirmities, and hath mercy on our iniquities. This is he onely of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Iob ſpeaketh, chap. 27. God hath mollifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my hart, and the Almighty hath put my ſoule in bitternes, God onely doth giue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. For as Saint Paule ſaith, It is the gift of God, 2. Tim. 2.25. When he willeth vs, to inſtruct with meeknes them that are contrary minded, proouing if God at anie time will giue them repentance, that they may know the truth. So that the mercy of God is neceſſary, not onely in the worke of repentance, but before wee doe repent. According to that in the pſalm. Thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy ô Lord ſhall preuent me.</p>

Therefore there muſt goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore repentance, a holy anger and inward griefe and diſcontentment, that wee haue diſpleaſed God.

               <p>Truly did the Apoſtle S. Paule ſpeak. 1. Cor. 15.9. I am not worthy to be called an Apoſtle, becauſe I perſecuted the Church of God ioyfully remembring gods mercy, and his own happy returne. For the more graciouſly the lord doth viſit a ſinner with his mercy, the more deeply doth it ſink into the hart of a true penitent ſinner, the more doth he hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble himſelfe before God, &amp; the more greeuouſly doth he accuſe his owne wicked nature and diſpoſition.

His Father doth not ſpeake any thundering words of crueltie, nor threaten to beate him, or to caſt him off, nor to caſt him in the teeth with his bounteous goodnes ſhewed vnto him; neyther doth he lay vnto him his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away, nor burden him with his glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony, or other abhominable poynts of ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, he remembreth none of all this geare, he doth ſo greatly reioyce that he hath got his Sonne againe. The Son thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe vnworthy the title or name of his ſon, yet the father reſtoreth him to his old ſtate and degree againe. The ſonne doth vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condemne himſelfe, and the father doth abſolue and quit him. The ſonne did caſt himſelfe downe to be a ſeruaunt, and the father ſetteth him perfectly againe in his old ſtate &amp; dignitie. Him that had caſt him ſelfe into the bond ſeruice of abhominable maiſters, that is, the filthy pleaſures of the body, him did his father vouchſafe to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace in his armes; to him that had deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to bee ſcourged vvith many a ſore

How-ſoeuer hee hath behaued himſelfe, ſaith his Father, my ſon he was, he hath beene dead, and nowe is he called to life againe. For ſin is the death of the ſoule, and hee runneth toward death, which leaueth and forſaketh the Authour of life. Hee leaueth and forſaketh the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of life, whoſoeuer is in loue with the things of this world, for the worldly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures are farre wide from Gods ſchooling. And ſuch a one is reuiued againe, as dooth repent and reforme his ſinfull life. He was loſt without any hope euer to be recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red againe, if he had be one left to himſelfe, howbeit he was found and gotten againe. To depart away from the fathers houſe, is to perriſh, for out of the ſame houſe, there is no health.</p>

So God is moſt tender ouer them, that are newly conuerted vnto him, and beareth much with their infirmities, and helpeth them forward, and ſtayeth them as a nurſe doth her children. Therefore Chriſt did not onely louingly and mercifully receaue the publicanes and ſinners that repented, but was conuerſant with them, and did eate with them. He that found his loſt ſheepe,

So he aroſe and came to his Father, and when he was yet a great way off, his Father ſaw him and had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, and ranne and fell on his necke and kiſſed him.

Whereby we alſo haue a warning, to ſhew compaſſion one toward another, and to reioyce at the good one of another, ſeeing wee are the ſame people &amp; Nation, hauing one God, one Redeemer, one Baptiſme. Exod. 32. When the people had offended, the Lord ſaid vnto Moſes. Goe downe, thy people haue committed a great ſin.

The benefits that GOD daily poureth downe vpon vs, ſhewe that our deſtruction com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not from him, but wee our ſelues are the workers of our owne ouerthrow. And when we are reſtored, we are to reioyce of Gods mercy and goodnes, &amp;c to accuſe &amp; condemne our owne wilfulnes, froward &amp; ſtubborne nature, which ſo rebelliouſlie is ſet to contrary Gods commaundements, and holy will and law.</p>
               <p>By this parable, ſinners are to behold an aſſured truſt in Gods mercy that they may learne to repent, and to yeelde themſelues to Gods calling.

Who was therefore ſent of God the Father, into this
<pb facs="tcp:20355:126"/>world to ſaue ſinners. 2. Tim. 1.15. For God hath not ſent his Son into the world, to iudge the world, but that the world by him ſhould be ſaued. Ioh. 3.17.</p>
               <p>The Father of this prodigall ſonne, had more ioy in the recouery of his ſonne, then in the loſſe of that great wealth and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. Vnder the example of the Father, pleading in the behalfe of his prodigall ſonne, is manifeſtly declared howe Chriſt aunſwereth for ſinners, becommeth theyr Patron, Aduocate, and defender: that we alſo may learne to humble our ſelues, to the releaſe and helpe of ſinners, to be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, louing, and modeſt to all, and to be well inclined euen toward our very ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, which continually murmur &amp; ſpeak ill of vs. Which thing if thou ſhalt frame thy ſelfe vnto, &amp; doe thy endeuour to the beſt of thy power, thou ſhalt liue in peace, both with God and man, &amp; haue the loue and good will of all, and after this life en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, thou ſhalt be pertaker of eternall ioy.

               <p>Thirdly, the ioyfull eſtate of the godly after death, being ful of vnſpeakable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and glory.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:20355:127"/>
               <p>Fourthly, the lamentable eſtate of the wicked after death. Wiſd.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the word of God, beeing deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the prophets, Chriſt, and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, is reuerently to be heard, &amp; dutifully to bee obeyed, which to our great good, calleth vs to repentance, &amp; newnes of life.</p>
               <p>The Euangeliſts haue not diſpoſed all things in order, but haue ſet forth the effect of Chriſt his exhortations, ſo farre forth as vvas needfull, to the edification of the Church. And in this parable, our Sauiour doth ſhew what ſhall be come of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, which hauing no regard of the pore, giue themſelues wholy to their pleaſures, in the meane time ſuffering the poore to hunger and ſtarue, while they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue them. Although it ſeeme to ſome a plaine parable, yet it is more likely it was a thing doone, becauſe the name of Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus is put to. The effect of this parable is, to with-drawe vs from the abuſe of our wealth and riches, and to perſwade vs vnto bountifulneſſe and liberalitie towarde the poore. For whom would not the lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and of the Rich man feare, &amp; in time to make them learne to be mercifull to the poore.</p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:20355:127"/>
               <p>The rich man is heere ſet downe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any mention of his name, becauſe god raketh no care of the wicked, nor remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breth their names. We are willed to make vs friendes of our riches, not by purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Lands, but by giuing to the poore, that when we ſhall want, as the poore now doe, then they may receiue vs into euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting habitations. And by this example he perſwadeth vs, that we doe not neglect, or forget, or diſdaine to giue almes. For who would not theſe words teniſie, [Sonne, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that thou in thy life time recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uedſt thy pleaſures, and like wife Lazarus paynes; now therefore is he comforted, &amp; thou art tormented]</p>
               <p>This is a in of trailous change, and a miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable alteration, to ſee any but the other day, to fare daintily, and to goe brauely, &amp; after a while to be tormented with thirſt, to be naked and ſpoyled of all helps.

VVoe be vnto them, for euerlaſting damnation doth ſtay for them. And as the world doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to his end, ſo in all bad vſages it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds.</p>
               <p>Howe can wee thinke our ſelues to be in the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of Chriſtians, when as Chriſt moſt earneſtly taught humility, tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, contempt of the world, and charitie in words and in deedes, when as now there is nothing leſſe practiſed? But rather in ſteede thereof, pride, lechery, couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and crueltie. But ſurely the enemie of our ſaluation, the enuious man hath ſowed this darnall, while wee ſleepe, and
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:20355:130"/>while our Paſtours ſlept, which ſhoulde watch ouer vs, and inſtruct vs: and this his cockle and darnell, hath hee ſowed in the midſt and thickeſt of our corne. Let vs heereafter learne, that wee are not called to theſe fore-ſaid vanities, but to beare Chriſt his croſſe.</p>
               <p>If thys vve will not vouchſafe to learne, let vs feare to taſte of the Rich mans tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. VVee eaſily ſlide into theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities, through the corruption of our ovvne nature. For the roote of iniquitie is in vs, ſending foorth branches, which ſtill budde foorth bloſſoms, and our nature to euill, is very fruitfull and very aboundant. Gene. chap. 6. pſalm. 14. A couetous rich man, is loued of no man, becauſe hee is onely good for himſelfe. Other ſinners, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they hurt themſelues, yet they are profitable to others. The proude man hath a great familie; the gorgious builder ſets manie men a worke.</p>
               <p>Beſide, the couetous hurt the Common vveale mightily, keeping in prouiſion, and making a dearth. And many of them in thys theyr floriſhing, would be accounted of the poore people and common ſort, as if they were gods.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:20355:131"/>
               <p>There was a certaine Rich man.] For indeed they looke to be alone. There was, but now he is not, he is gone and vaniſhed. pſal. 37.36. I my ſelfe haue ſeene the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly in great proſperity, &amp; floriſhing like a greene Bay tree: and I went by, and loe hee was gone, I ſought him, but his place could no where be found. And beeing in hell, this they can ſay, Wiſd. 5. What hath pride profited vs, and the pompe of riches brought vs? All theſe things are paſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way like a ſhadow, and as a poſt that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth by, as an arrow out of the bow, and as a ſhyp vppon the ſea, which is ſwift vnder ſaile. Where are infinite number of wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy men, that haue liued heretofore, and is not theyr remembrance quite forgotten? They that ſeeke fame in earthly thinges, theyr fame hath an end,<note place="margin">Name.</note> but the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the iuſt ſhall alwaies floriſh, as Ioſias, whoſe remembrance is as honny in the mouth, and as muſick at a banket. The memory of the wicked. God dooth roote out, as he rooted out the remembrance of Amelek from of the earth. The Rich man is not named, as the pſal. 69.29. ſaith, Let them be wiped out of the booke of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, and not be written among the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous.
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:20355:131"/>As when wee talke with a ſtranger, and our friend aske who it was, we ſay, we know him not, becauſe we regard him not, neither doe we care for him.</p>
               <p>Clothed in purple.] Not that all gorgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous apparrell diſpleaſeth God, or that the fineneſſe thereof is vtterly damnable, but becauſe it ſeldome falls out, but that vvee exceede heerein.

               <p>For his rich and ouer-ſumptuous appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, he ſpent his riches waſtfully. Not but according to theyr degree, men and vvo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens apparrell may be more coſtly then other-ſome, and yet all ought to bee in a meaſure. But now the worlde is giuen to this exceſſe, that euery one wil go in theſe expences of apparell, farre beyond theyr bounds. Nay, in this reſpect, ſeruants, and thoſe of the meaneſt calling, can ſcarcely be knowne from theyr maiſters &amp; betters. Euery ones minde is on great ruffes, and for want of maintenaunce, they will ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the beſt ioynt in theyr body, til at laſt
<pb facs="tcp:20355:132"/>theyr great ruffes come to rough halters. Alas, if they did confider, a time of ſicknes may come, when theyr great ruffes wil do them no good, a time or trouble, when thy mony may ſtand thee in ſteede, thy ruffe cannot help: a time of preferment, a time of age, and diuers are the caſualties of our life, whereon our mony might farre be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter beſtowed.</p>
               <p>The men and vvemen in former times, were not ſo arraied, but were content with that which was decent. The garments that God prepared for our firſt parents, vvere of Goates skinnes. Gene. 3.21. Chriſt his garment was ſimple and plaine, without any ſeame. The holy vvemen in the firſt age of the world, euen Abrahams vvife, that great rich woman, tyred herſelfe moſt modeſtly, herein obeying her husband. 1. Pet. 3. chap. For many vvemen in this do much contrary theyr husbands will, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out modeſtie, going beyonde their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands calling, and without care of impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueriſhing his eſtate, floriſh for a time, and afterward come to decay. But the modeſt and ſober behauiour of men and vvomen in thys reſpect, eſpecially of Chriſtians, is a meane whereby other are wonne to nue
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:20355:132"/>religion. 1. Pet. 3.1. Heb. 11.37.38. Such of whom the world was vnworthy, vvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered about in Sheepskinnes.

               <p>By braue attire, the mind is reared vp in pryde, and in forgetfulneſſe of GOD: and who is it among a hundred, that in this caſe thinke themſelues to be but duſt and and aſhes, and that they haue no long time of continuaunce heere? Yea who is it that had any meditation of another life, that would not treade this vanity vnder foote.

And many a ones chiefeſt glory, is their chiefeſt ſhame, while they reroyce in their vanitie, and in the works of iniquitie. Many liue to eate, but let vs liue to ſerue the Lord.

Take heede to yourſelues ſaith Chriſt, Luk. 21.34. leaſt at any time your harts be oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with ſurfetting and drunkenneſſe, and leaſt that day come on you at vnawares.
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:20355:134"/>For as it was in the daies of Noe, Luke, 17.26. ſo ſhal it be in the dayes of the ſonne of man; they are, they dranke, they marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wiues, and gaue in marriage, vnto the day that Noe went into the Arke, and the flood came, and deſtroyed them all.

               <p>Haue conuenient care for thy body, but let it not be thy chiefeſt ſtudie, but rather let it be thy chiefeſt care, how thou mayſt be rid from theſe cares. The body is but the garment of thy ſoule, and who would make more account of the garment, then of the body, and of the body, rather then of the ſoule? Yet for the moſt part, the world is ſet vppon banketting and carow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, &amp; he is not a man in theſe dayes, that cannot quaffe and carowſe, and drinke as much as a horſe.

               <p>Poets haue mightily inueighed againſt the ryot of their people, but if they vvere now among Chriſtians, what would they do? what would they ſpeak? what would they write? Surely they would hold theyr peace and wonder and grieue with ſorrow of hart. This I thinke was a great cauſe of the vnmercifulnes of the rich man, toward Lazarus, that he thought all prouiſion but little enough for himſelfe. Let vs learne abſtinence and ſobrietie, according to the counſell of the Apoſtle, Ro. 8. If yee liue

For a day or two thou maiſt be merry with thy friends, but in ſuch ſort that thou leaue not of thy manner of praying, heauenly meditations, &amp; thy ſtraite courſe of life.

               <p>Yet this is worthy the noting, that God dooth graunt theſe ſinners and rich men, health, riches &amp; many dainties, to this end, that by theſe meanes, he might allure and

The Lord wayteth for the conuerſion of ſinners, that they ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his great goodnes, and how much they are indebted, may at the laſt relent. But if there be ſome few that doe relent, there are many thouſands, the more is the pitty, that are too too ſtubberne, abuſing Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings at their pleaſure, as this rich man did. To ſuch the Prophet Ezechiell giueth warning, chap. 16. by the example of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. This was the ſin of Sodome pride, fulnes of bread, aboundance of idlenes, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did they ſtrengthen the hand of the poore and needy. Thus much of this rich mans exceſſe in apparrell, and riot in fare; the third is of his vnmercifulnes towarde poore Lazarus. But before we handle that
<pb facs="tcp:20355:137"/>point, let vs ſee what manner of man this poore Lazarus was, euen an image &amp; pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne of the godly, afflicted in this world, and in manifold diſtreſſe.</p>
               <p>And there was a certaine begger named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate full of ſores.] Lazarus is heere named, becauſe GOD hath care of the godly, and their names are written in the booke of life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe being ſuſtained by hope, with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence they endure ſuch croſſes and afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that it pleaſeth GOD to lay vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them, for the try all of theyr fayth, and for theyr further exaltation in the lfe to come.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> And heere beginneth the ſecond prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall matter, namely that vnder Lazarus, is contained the patterne of a godly man, ſubmitting him ſelfe to Gods will in all his diſtreſſes, and wayting for comfort and deliuerance, according to Gods good will and pleaſure.</p>
               <p>Among worldly men, the rich men are knowne aboue the reſt, and when wee talke of them, their names are perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred; but as for the pore, their names are vnknowne, or if wee doe know them, we can ſcarcely vouchſafe to call them by
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:20355:137"/>their names. Howbeit the Paſtours and Miniſters ought to haue care of them, as if they were their own children. Where we reade in the booke of Deut. That there ſhould be no poore, we muſt not think it a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement, that none ſhould beg, but that the rich ſhold not ſee the poore want, &amp; that they ſhould miniſter all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And indeed if the rich men were ſuch as they ſhould be, there ſhould be no begger, nor any to beg from dore to dore. For if they duly conſider it, they are but ſtewards, &amp; God hath put the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in truſt, to diſpoſe thoſe riches which he hath put into their hands. Many wonder and fay, Why doth God grant to the wicked rich man, ſuch ſtore of wealth &amp; riches, &amp; why doth he ſuffer poore Lazarus,<note place="margin">Why the godly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted.</note> &amp; the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the moſt part, to be ſubiect to ſuch extremities, &amp; to endure ſo many inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences? In which queſtion they are ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled, that they cannot finde out any fit anſwere to ſatisfie their minds. But Gods works doe proceede in ſuch order, that if any thing doe ſeeme to vs to goe out of order, wee muſt blame the weakenes of our owne capacity, and not the wiſedome of God, which is farre beyond our reach.</p>

Rich men giue giftes to the rich, but towarde the poore they are too ſparing: too prodigall tovvard the vvorlde, and toward GOD too wretched. As the Iſraelites gaue their Iewels, to the making of a golden calfe, ſo doe the rich men to their harlots, and to the committing of outrages, they care not what they ſpend.</p>

Theſe louers of the world, and enemies of their owne ſoules, how many Lazarus doe they ſee, &amp; will not ſee, turning away their eyes, being more carefull for their Horſes, and Hounds, &amp; Pages, then for the poore, whom Chriſt hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended vnto them. Of ſuch maner of people, the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth by his prophet Amos, chap. 6. They put farre away the euill day, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to the ſeate of iniquity. They lie vpon beds of Iuory, &amp; ſtretch themſelues vpon their beds, and eate the Lambs of the flocke, and the fat Calues. They ſing to the ſound of the Violl, they drinke vvine in boules, and annoynt them ſelues with the chiefe oyntments, but no man is ſorry for the afflictions of Ioſeph. And this rich man in his iolity, had no regard of poore Lazarus. But that the rich man and all his houſe ſhould be vtterly aſhamed, and left without excuſe: ſee what followeth.</p>
               <p>Yea, and the doggs came, and licked his ſores.] When the Prophet Balaam did wickedly, God opened the mouth of his
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:20355:140"/>Aſſe hee rode on, to giue him vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and theſe doggs that had better fare to taſt, licked Lazarus ſores, to reach their maiſter mercy. O cruell people, more mercileſſe then dogges, which commonly hunt the poore from the doore, yet nowe they were pittifull to condemne their mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters great vnkindnes, and to make them if they had any grace, to bluſh for ſhame. The property of dogs is to barke and bite at ſtrangers, and to driue them away. But heere the kind nature of doggs, ouercame the hard harts of men, and they are more gentle and louing, then men that ſhould haue ſhewed mercy. The rich man was cloathed in ſoft and coſtly rayment, &amp; fed with dainties to the full, and is laide vpon his beds of downe. But the poore man pines with famine, is pincht with cold, and a meruaile it is, that hee liueth among his great wants, and as the other lay eaſily vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon his ſoft bed, ſo the poore man had no other lodging then the bare ground. But as they were vnlike in life, ſo were they far vnlike in death, as the euent of the hiſtory doth prooue. We all die, and as water we paſſe away, the rich and poore, the noble and baſe, the learned and vnlearned, all are
<pb facs="tcp:20355:141"/>ſubiect to death, and when death com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that makes a newe alteration. For many that haue beene moſt miſerable in this world, after death haue a ioyfull eſtate, and many that did flouriſh in this worlde, after death ſee all thinges changed quite contrary.</p>
               <p>And it was ſo that the begger died, and was caried by the Angels, into Abrahams boſome.] Lazarus dieth as though hee were forſaken of God and man, and the rich man lyueth yet longer, to enioy his pleaſure. Yet a little while, and ſurely but a little while, although in the ſight of the world, his life be long.</p>

The godly greatly deſire to bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burdened of this miſerable life, wherein they are daily in daunger to looſe eternall life, for the beſt may fall. Philip. 1.21. And when this life is ended, all ſinnes and ſorrowes haue an ende alſo. God calleth the ſinner to repentance, that hee may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy heauen.

The deuill dooth greedily wayte for the death of a ſinner, fearing leaſt while he liueth, he may repent, although hee ſeeme neuer ſo deſperate. But when the ſinner dyeth in his ſinne, the deuills reioyce, ſaying, Now thou art ours, and haſt loſt euerlaſting life for euer, thou art ours and no man can deliuer thee, or take thee out of our hands.

For in this life the rich are of chiefeſt account, in chiefeſt places, in bankers and iudgement ſeates, in honour and dignity, who but they. But in ſpeaking of them; being dead, Lazarus is firſt mentioned, for before the wicked rich, the godly poore are preferred in another life. The glory of the godly begins in their death, as the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the wicked doth end in their death. The miſery of Lazarus is ended in his death, for hee whom no man regarded in his life, the Angels tooke him vppe after death. And who would haue thought, that this poore wretch being ſo deſpiſed, ſhold be ſo accepted of God, but the wayes of God doe far differ from the waies of men, neither are his thoughts as our thoughts. Eſay, 55. But to ſee howe God doth ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the godly in their death, let vs marke what followeth.</p>
               <p>And was carried by the Angels into A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams boſome.<note place="margin">And, &amp;c.</note>] Whereby we vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that the Angels are preſent at the death of the godly, to performe theyr charge appointed vnto them. Heb. 1, 14. Pſal. 91, 11. O happy ſoule which heere
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:20355:142"/>was viſited of none but of dogs, nowe not one Angell, but many Angels come to do it ſeruice. So that the deuill hath no power ouer the ſoules of the godly, but ouer the veſſels appointed vnto wrath. A bay or boſome is a hauen &amp; place, free from tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent waues; the world is the maine ſea, and heauen the hauen of reſt. And he that in life could finde no comfort, after death was carried into Abrahams boſome, that man of great compaſſion and hoſpitalitie. Or rather, becauſe Abraham was the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the faithfull, hee is there placed where Abraham is: or more neere, where Chriſt our head is, there ſhall the godly &amp; faithfull, Chriſt his members be. Iohn. 14.1.2. And although heere is no mention made of Lazarus buriall, wee muſt not therefore ſuppoſe, that he was caſt foorth to the foules of the ayre, or the beaſtes of the field, for no doubt he was laid in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian buriall, but his buriall is not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, becauſe it was not performed vvith pompe &amp; ſolemnitie, as the rich mans bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall was, which was the laſt of all the Rich mans pride and brauery.

It is appointed to all men to die, and after death commeth iudgement. Heb. 9.27. And no otherwiſe likely it was, but that this Rich man had his doome and iudgement, before he vvas ſent to hell. For after his death and buriall, was hee condemned and forſaken of God, and vtterly depriued of all ioy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>
               <p>And beeing in hell in torments, hee lyft vp his eyes,<note place="margin">And &amp;c.</note> and ſawe Abraham a farre of, and Lazarus in his boſome.] VVhat did his pompous buriall doe him any good, as the rich men take great care for theyr glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious funeralls; but as for poore Lazarus, there was no mention made of his buriall. But better were it for rich men, to haue a rich ſoule to God, then after theyr world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly braueries, to be throwne down into hell. Hee went not downe to hell, to ſee vvhat there was done, but to feele that which was intollerable, and to abide ſuch miſery, that neuer ſhould haue end. And why was it? he came to his goods aright, but hee did not diſpoſe them as God commaunded. Hee was no thiefe nor Vſurer, but onely
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:20355:143"/>vnmercifull, and therefore found no mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. If he were ſo greeuouſly puniſhed, for not vſing his owne goods well, what ſhall become of thieues &amp; Vſurers, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue other men of theyr goods, and doe vniuſtly detaine them.</p>
               <p>Helliſh torments can no more bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued, then heauenly ioyes, both beeing infinite. And as in hope, wee haue ſome taſte and feeling of heauenly ioyes, ſo is it ſufficient to knowe theſe endleſſe vvoes in groſſe, and after a ſort, though confuſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſo farre foorth, as may ſerue to keepe vs in Gods feare. And though we cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the depth of theſe matters, let vs leaue of to be curious, &amp; meditate on thoſe things which are moſt neceſſary. In thys example we learne, that the wicked throgh the feeling of their miſery, are meruallouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vexed, and are deſirous of ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. Yet all hope being cut of, they feele a double torment. Firſt, the remembrance of theyr manifold and hainous ſinnes, is a continuall torment vnto them. Secondly, the conſideration of the ioyes of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, increaſeth their griefe farre more, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring their vnſpeakable ioyes, with their endleſſe and vnſufferable miſeries.</p>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortleſſe hee was, in that hee required but one drop of water to coole his tongue, and could not haue it, although he earneſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted the ſame, hauing the leaſt comfort denied him, that was vnmercifull in ſmall matters. And laſtly, in fearing the damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his bretheren, which were yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue, and were like to drinke of the ſame cup.

He doth not behold him with the eyes of his body, but with the eyes of his mind, his vnderſtanding was now opened, which in his life time was ſhut. The Wiſe man counſelleth, that we ſhould not turne away our eyes from the poore, leaſt the Lord turne away his face from vs. And as the Mold-warpe, ſo is the rich man blind all his life, and cannot ſee himſelfe, nor God, but is altogether buſied about earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſiderations. And as the Moldwarpe is ſaid to open his eies at the time of death,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:20355:144"/>ſo theſe rich men at the time of death, can ſay, Vanity of vanities, vanity of vanities; and all is but vanitie.

Diues liued in this world in ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, &amp; Lazarus in labour and ſorrow, but now is Lazarus exalted &amp; hee tormented. As the Lord ſaith by the prophet Eſay. 65.13. Behold, my ſeruaunts ſhall eate, &amp; ye ſhal be hungry, my ſeruants ſhall drink, &amp; ye ſhal be thirſty, my ſeruants ſhal reioyce, and yee ſhall be aſhamed.

Lazarus in this life begged of the rich man, but the rich man after begged of the poore man: and as the rich man heard him not, ſo was not he heard. As wee reade, Prou. 21.13.

For as God when hee caſt Adam out of Paradice, placed him not farre from thence, that hee might daily beholde from what a bleſſed place hee was baniſhed, ſo did GOD ſet before the eyes of the rich man, the happy eſtate of Lazarus, that he ſhould be vexed ſo much the more.

               <p>What great increaſe of ſorrow was this, that he ſhould deſire to haue comfort fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Lazarus, &amp; yet could haue none.

Now he calleth him Father Abraham, whom hee would not follow in his life time; againe, he calleth him father too late, &amp; repenteth too late. See what it is to boaſt of the name of a Chriſtian, and not to ſhewe the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe thereof in our life &amp; conuerſation. For not euery one that can ſay, Lorde, Lorde, ſhall enter into the kingdome of heauen, but hee that dooth the will of my Father which is in heauen. Math. 7.21.22.

And he ſhall haue iudgement with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mercy, that ſheweth no mercy. Math. chap. 18.</p>
               <p>Heere-hence wee may gather two pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable inſtructions. The firſt is, to ſhewe mercy to our poore neighbour, if vve will looke for mercy at Gods hands. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to call for mercy and forgiuenes, and pardon of our ſinnes in this life, and not to deferre it vntill the laſt howre, or at leaſt wiſe till after death. To defer it to the laſt howre, is to hazzardous and venterous, when as we may ſooner miſſe, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to haue our requeſt graunted; the other that is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter death, is altogether vaine and vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.

Endeuour therefore what thou canſt. to be mercifull to the poore, calling thy ſelfe to remembe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, how greatly thou ſtandeſt in neede of mercy from God. As for this rich mans too late repentance, hee was not ſo wiſe as Dauid, pſal. 50. Heare ô Lord, and haue mercy vpon me, Lord be thou my helper: for what profit is there when I goe downe to the pitte; and out of hell there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. And therefore earneſtly and humbly hee prayeth for mercy in his lyfe time, before the eternall barres doe cloſe him in. Neither did this rich man repent that hee had offended God, but beeing in exceſſiue paine, he called for releaſe, vvhen as then none would bee granted. Follow the Wiſe mans counſell, Eccles. 9.10.

And vvee which woulde not fore-ſee theſe eternall puniſhments, ſhall then be thruſt dovvne among the damned, for euer to feele them.

               <p>Let no man deſpiſe the poore, for God can make the richeſt man poore in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

               <p>VVhere there is mention made of the rich mans tongue, wee muſt vnderſtand that the ſoule hath no tongue, nor hands, nor fingers,<note place="margin">Tongue.</note> but this is rather to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode in a ſpirituall conſideration. The ſoules haue no parts nor members of the body, becauſe they are ſpirits. Yet they are ſayde to ſuffer in the members of the body, becauſe in thoſe members they haue moſt offended. As this rich man in his dainty fare and delicate dyet. Balthazar after his banquets and boules of vvine, loſt his Kingdome and his life, 2, Maccabees, 15, 13. Nicanor blaſphemed GOD, and therfore Maccabeus hand conquered him, cauſed his head and hands to be cutte off, and his tongue to be cutte out, and giuen to the fowles.</p>

This torment is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by Saint Iohn, in his Reuelations, 16, 10. They gnew their tongues for ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rovve. And blaſphemed the GOD of heauen for theyr paynes, and for theyr ſores, and repented not of theyr vvorkes. Heere-hence lette vs learne to bridle our tongues, becauſe as Saint Paul ſaith, What ſoeuer thinges are written, are written for our inſtruction.</p>
               <p>VVhy did not the rich man require the helpe of Iacob, Ioſeph, Iob, Dauid, and the lyke; becauſe the poore vvere brought foorth for the rich, that they ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them might be prouoked to liberality, and that GOD might fauour them the more:<note place="margin">Many good inſtructions in behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the poore.</note> and eſpecially that the poore mans prayers aſcending aboue the skies, might preuaile for them: not after death, for our prayers preuaile one for another while we liue.</p>

               <p>But Abraham ſaide, Sonne, remember that thou in thy life time, receauedſt thy pleaſures, &amp; likewiſe Lazarus paines, now therefore is hee comforted, and thou art tormented.]</p>
               <p>He puts him inmind of his former flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing eſtate, to vexe him ſo much the more. For it is one of the vnhappieſt thinges in our great miſery, to remember that we haue been happy. Remember that thou in thy life time as if he had ſaid; Thou haſt liued to thy ſelfe &amp; not to God, thou haſt ſerued thy owne luſts and pleaſures, &amp; haſt not lined in Gods obedience, thou haſt had all the care for thy ſelfe, and not for thy neighbor.

Bleſſed are they that mourn, for they ſhal be comforted. When Iacob bleſſed Ioſephs ſonnes, hee put the youngeſt at the right hand. In this world the wealthy are at the right hand of glory, the poore at the left hand of ſhame, but in the world to come, it ſhal be otherwiſe, for God will exalt the poore and throw down the mighty.

               <p>He might alſo call him Maiſter in moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kery, as in the court of Pontius Pilate, they clapt a crowne of thornes vpon his head, put a reed in his hands, &amp; bowed the knee diſdainfully, and ſang, Haile King of the Iewes, and all to deride him. Alſo in the houſe of Caiaphas, making a ieſt of his propheticall function, they hid his eyes, &amp; ſtrooke him on the face, ſaying: Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie who it was that ſmote thee. And as in his paſſion and prophecy, they ſcorned him, ſo now in his doctrine, they call him maiſter, but in the way of mockage.</p>
               <p>He is deſirous to know howe to obtaine euerlaſting life, becauſe it is the marke that euery one ſhooteth at, though there be few that vſe the means. This life although it ſeeme neuer ſo long, yet is it but of ſhort co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuance, in reſpect of the time to come: for he that ſhall recount with himſelfe the time paſt, it ſeemeth vnto him but as ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterday, or rather but as a moment. So Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob at his firſt comming into Egypt, when Pharao demaunded of him how olde hee was, aunſwered: The dayes of my pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, are a hundred and thirtie yeeres: fewe &amp; euill are the dayes of my life.

<pb n="156" facs="tcp:20355:163"/>becauſe of the manifold miſeries, &amp; vvea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſome labours that fall out continually in our life.</p>
               <p>VVherefore, as the fowles deſire to flie, the fiſhes to ſwimme, and creeping things to craule vpon the earth, neither is nature deceaued in theſe operations: ſo doe men naturally deſire euerlaſting felicitie, the which the minde dooth alwayes long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and cannot be ſatiſ-fied, and neuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth, vntil it hath obtained it; which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe cannot bee accompliſhed in thys life, but in that which is to come.

Chriſt ſaith in the goſpell of Saint Iohn, Euery branch that beareth not fruite, hee taketh away: by taking away, hee meaneth caſting into the fire, that it may burne, becauſe it brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth not foorth fruite. And the Prophet Eſay, chapter 1. vvilleth the people of his ty me, to doe well. He ſayth not, Learne to ſay well, though that be good, but learne to doe well, which is harder; and alſo far more neceſſary.</p>
               <p>Infinite are the places of Scripture to this effect, all which conclude, howe that God doth farre more accept godly dooers, then idle talkers. To the ſubſtance of water, is added moyſture &amp; cold, it hath alſo theſe qualities, to be cleere, and very fluent, all which if they vvant, yet the ſubſtance of water remaineth. In a well ordered Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weale, the ſubſtance thereof is the peace and quietnes of the Cittizens, the neceſſary helps, are the mechanicall Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences and trades. So in the ſpirituall life of the ſoule, is faith, hope, charity; the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward &amp; neceſſary forniture thereof, is the Sacraments, ſpirituall ſacrifices, of prayer,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:20355:164"/>prayſe, thankſ-giuing, almes deedes, and all other godly and holy practiſes. For in theſe, thou muſt be fruitfull, if thou vvilt ſhew vnto the world, that thou haſt faith, hope and charitie. How ſhal it be known, that thou haſt charity, when thou haſt no almes deedes? how ſhall it be known, that thou haſt hope of another life, when as all thy ioy is ſetled in this world. All the glory of the Kings daughter, ſaith the Pſalmiſt, is from within, hauing within fayth, hope, and charity, and beeing outwardly ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with godly works. Heereby the ſoule becommeth glorious, but not ſo glorious, as it ſhalbe in the world to come. To theſe are required patience, conſtancie in perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, chaſtity, perſeuerance, &amp; many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vertues alſo, which nowe I cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite. But how can they ſay, that they haue a true fayth, whoſe life is moſt vngodly &amp; vncleane, being ouerloden with manifold iniquities.</p>
               <p>He asketh what he ſhal do, to inherit and poſſeſſe eternal life, for this life is but a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nement at wil. The heauenly inheritance is without chang &amp; that poſſeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is without diſplacing, or any alteration, &amp; how excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentis the eſtate of man, that is born to inioy
<pb facs="tcp:20355:165"/>and poſſeſſe heauen. Which in this life he cannot attaine, till death hath giuen the ſtroake, &amp; made a happy paſſage for him. Yet in this thy life, by thy lewdnes &amp; wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes, thou mayſt diſpoſſeſſe thy ſelfe of that heauenly inheritance. And in that it is called an inheritance, the bountifulnes and mercie of God, doth wonderfully ſhine &amp; ſhew it ſelfe; for they that are heires, come not vnto their inheritance by deſert. But now let vs heare what Chriſt his aunſwere was.</p>
               <p>And heſayd vnto him, What is written in the law? how readeſt thou?] Certaine it is that the law doth ſet down a rule, how to frame our liues, and to obtaine euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting life, yet can it doe nothing els but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne vs: and therefore it is called the miniſtration of death and condemnation. 2. Cor. 3.7. Yea, it increaſeth the gilt and waight of our ſinne, and maketh it to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare more manifeſtly. Rom. 7.13. All vvhich comes not to paſſe through the fault of the law,<note place="margin">Law.</note> beeing holy, iuſt, &amp; good, but becauſe our corupt nature is ſo badde, that it is more ready to breake. then to keepe the lawe. Rom. 8.3. Therefore, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though no man be iuſtified by the Lawe,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:20355:165"/>yet the law dooth containe perfect righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes, neither doth it promiſe euerlaſting life in vaine, if wee were able perfectly to fulfill it. Neither ought this doctrine to ſeeme ſtrange vnto vs, that God doth firſt require the righteouſnes of works, &amp; then offer euerlaſting life without the deſert of works. Becauſe it is moſt neceſſary that we ſhould firſt know our miſerable eſtate, not onely in tranſgreſſing the Law, but alſo in deſeruing the curſe and puniſhment ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted there-vnto, that ſo we may more earneſtly and more humbly, ſeek the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of God, in the death and paſſion of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Our owne righteouſnes cannot obtaine euerlaſting life, therefore it muſt be the free mercy of God that muſt do it. Chriſt hauing regarde to the Lawyers queſtion, aunſwered him aright. For hee did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire howe hee might obtaine euerlaſting ſaluation, but by what workes hee might accompliſh the ſame, ſaying: What ſhall I doe to inherit euerlaſting life. The Lawe doth ſhew how we are iuſtified by works, and yet no man is iuſtified by workes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we cannot performe it. In the meane time Chriſt doth preuent their ſlau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derous
<pb facs="tcp:20355:166"/>offence, vvho ſought to intrap him, as though he did peruert and ouerthrow the law.</p>
               <p>A maruell it is that thou, ſaith Chriſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, which art a Doctor of the lawe, art ignorant of this point, who ſhould teach others. Would God many that are Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and of great yeeres, did not ſtand in neede to be inſtructed in the doctrine of Chriſtianitie, or rather in the principles of religion. Who make great boaſt of theyr perfection, &amp; yet being asked, are not able to render an account of their faith. And yet this is a further inconuenience, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they are ſo ignorant, yet they wold be loth ſo to be accounted, and alſo vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to learne. Set ſhame aſide, for this is no ſhame to learne to bee inſtructed. A craftſman is of no reckning that is vnskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in his trade, and hee is vnwoorthie the the name of a Chriſtian, that is ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant in Chriſtian religion. And as fooliſh pitty dooth marre a Cittie, ſo vvorldlie ſhame in matters of religion, dooth ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw pietie.</p>
               <p>Chriſt ſends this Lawyer to the Law, in the knowledge whereof he did ſo aduance himſelfe: firſt, that he ſhould be ſatiſ-fied
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:20355:166"/>by his own knowledge: and ſecondly, that he ſhould make it manifeſt, that in the law and word of GOD, is ſhewed the way of ſaluation, which teacheth what we ſhould beleeue, doe, follow, feare, and auoyd. For the whole Scripture, as ſaith Saint Paul. 2. Tim. 3.16. is giuen by inſpiration of God, and is profitable to teach, to improoue, to correct, and to inſtruct in righteouſneſſe. That the man of God may bee abſolute, beeing made perfect vnto all good works. Therfore Chriſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeth vs to ſearch the Scriptures. Iohn. 5.39.</p>
               <p>Chriſt ſendeth the Lawyer to the Law, and the ſearching of the word: hee ſendes him not into the pallaces of Princes, where it ſeemeth is the moſt happy life, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the ſoule doth there gather infection, which dooth rather tende to the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then the ſaluation thereof.

Holy loſeph, that patterne of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie, loued god aboue all, who being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uited by his Miſtreſſe to commit adultery, gaue this wiſe and diſcreete aunſwere, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting God before his eyes, Gen. 39. Hovv canſt doe this great wickednes, and ſo ſin againſt god? He had rather looſe his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull pleaſure; then looſe God. Holy Dauid, when hee might haue ſlaine King Saule, choſe rather not to offeud god, then to reuenge himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Renouned and chaſt Suſanna, when ſhe might haue offended god without any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment, or open knowledge in reſpect of the world, the thing beeing kept cloſe: yet ſhee had rather in a good cauſe, vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe any worldly ſhame, or great wrong &amp; iniury what-ſoeuer, then to forſake God, her hope, her crowne, &amp; her caſtle. Loue thoſe thinges which god dooth ſuffer thee to enioy in this vvorlde, as much as thou wilt, for god dooth giue thee large liberty, ſo that when there is any occaſion of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending god offered, then wee gather our wits together, and looke about vs, as did
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:20355:169"/>holie Ioſeph, Dauid, Daniell, &amp; the three chyldren, Suſanna, and the like, louing god aboue all, and in the higheſt degree, rather ſubmitting our ſelues to any tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment what-ſoeuer, then by offending god to hazzard our ſoules, in euerlaſting tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>And thy neighbour as thy ſelfe.] Our Sauiour may ſeeme heerein too much to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend vnto vs the loue of our neighbor, in that he ioynes it ſo neere vnto the loue of god. How-beit, the loue of god, &amp; the loue of thy neighbour, ſpring both from one fountaine, &amp; from one inward affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp; fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one cauſe, ſo that they cannot be ſeparated or parted a ſunder. Therefore S. Paul ſaith. Hee that loueth his neighbour, hath fulfilled the lawe. Thou canſt not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoid the loue of thy neighbour, but thou muſt ſhake off the loue of god alſo. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we may cleerly ſee, how much god doth account the loue of thy neighbour, that he thinks he is not loued, vnleſſe for his ſake we loue our neighbour alſo. As alſo that God in the 2. table of his lawe, hath ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken more largely of the loue of thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor. For the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements of the firſt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble are but 4. in nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements
<pb facs="tcp:20355:170"/>of the ſecond table, are ſixe, and yet in the firſt table, is contayned the loue of God. In the ſecond table, the commandements are all negatiue, but one, which doth ſhew the ſeueritie and ſtraitnes thereof, to make vs take the better heede. Therfore our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour ſaith, Ioh. 13. In this ſhal they know that you are my diſciples, if ye loue one an other. He ſayth not that ye are knowne to be my diſciples, by working miracles, or by the gift of prophecie; but if yee ſhall loue one another: for this is the badge of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, whereby they are diſtinguiſhed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the douils company.</p>
               <p>VVhen our Sauiour Chriſt taught his diſciples, (the time he was conuerſant with them) humilitie, patience, contempt of the world, and other chriſtian vertues and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: the perſwaſion of loue, charitie, and good will, he reſerued to his laſt ſupper, to the intent that hee might moſt firmly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print the loue of our neighbour, into the harts and memories of his diſciples. For this is giuen vs by nature, that looke what our friend doth giue vs laſt in charge, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he departeth from vs, that ſtickeſt longeſt in our remembrance. In this duty of loue, conſiſteth the perfection of al chriſtianity.
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:20355:170"/>Therefore S. Paule ſayth, that the whole lawe is comprehended in this one thing: Thou ſhalt loue thy neighbor as thy ſelfe. He that fulfilleth both theſe commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as he ought may without bluſhing appeare before God. Dauid ſaith, ô Lord I haue loued thy commaundements, and therefore he deſired the preſence of God, but Adam beeing called, fled from God, &amp; hid himſelfe, becauſe hee had diſobeyed God: and therefore durſt not come into his preſence. The prophet ſaith not, I haue knowne thy law, or I haue kept thy lawe, but I haue loued thy lawe. To keepe thy lawe, is of neceſſity and feare, but to loue, proceedeth from inward affection. The loue of God is perpetuall, but the loue of the worlde, or of our ſelues, is but for this life; for the loue of the worlde and of our ſelues, we indanger our ſelues, but for the loue of God, we finde a meanes to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the kingdome of God, and of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting ioyes. The eſpeciall cauſe of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing our neighbour, is in reſpect of his ſoule. And a good ſhepheard wil not ſpare to lay downe his life for his ſheepe, and many haue been content to be offered vp, for the confirmation of the faith of others.</p>

And although the Iewes by the priuiledge of adoption, were ſeperated from all other Nations, that they ſhould be Gods holy inheritance, yet ſuch was their barbarous, vnciuill, &amp; hetheniſh contempt one of another, as though there had beene no acquaintance, no fellow ſhip among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; as though they had not beene people of one and the ſelfe ſame Nation. Therefore our Sauiour Chriſt doth heere in this Parable, deſenbe theyr cruell neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of charitable affection, whereof theyr owne conſciences did pronounce them to be guiltie.</p>
               <p>The couetouſnes of this world hath offred violence vnto iuſtice, &amp; ſhe being thus

They that ſhoulde be moſt bountifull, are for the moſt part too hard-harted; and they that haue theyr liuings to be good to the poore, beeing blinded by couetouſnes, diſſemblingly paſſe by the poore, neither will they take notice of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, neyther will they enter into any feeling af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, or inward conſideration of theyr miſeries; the Lord make them to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber themſelues, that they may learne to be mercifull. For they are the ſeruants &amp; mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of him, that is moſt mercifull, and who cauſeth his raine to fall as well vppon the vniuſt as the iuſt.</p>
               <p>God gaue no poſſeſſion to the Leuites, becauſe he was theyr inheritance, whereby is ſignified, that he that then left the prieſts without any earthly poſſeſſion, would alſo haue it ſo nowe, that their harts ſhould be be eſtranged, from the loue of thys world, and earthly poſſeſſions, and from the gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die deſire of wealth, looking for no more then that, which ſhoulde ſerue their turne. Therefore, If the Miniſter ſerue God, and imploy his vocation diligently, let him not feare, ſeeing the Lord is his portion.</p>
               <pb n="183" facs="tcp:20355:177"/>
               <p>The Lord commaunded the people of Iſraell to allot out Cities to the Leuites.

Pharao gaue inheritance vnto the prieſts, &amp; when all the Egyptians were inforced to ſell theyr land for foode, the prieſts were ſpared. But now in theſe daies, the Miniſters liuings are ſo curiold, and theyr maintenaunce for the moſt part ſo poore and bare, that they are in a manner inforced with Saint Paule, to make Tents, &amp; to ſeeke wayes how they may liue, there are ſo many Church-robbers euery where.</p>

               <p>Seeing this Samaritane ſhewed greater kindnes, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eyther the Prieſt or the Leuit, heere-hence we may learne, that if we will be accounted more holy then other, &amp; of greater perfection, that we doe not ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haue our ſelues, that our conuerſation be worſe then ſouldiours &amp; publicans. You ſee that the prieſt and the Leuit, both of them were of the elect people of the Iews, and of that tribe which was prepared to doe God greateſt ſeruice, and which were iudged the holieft among the people, as they ſhould haue beene, and yet was there found in them, neyther charity nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion. But this Samaritane which was a gentile &amp; an idolater, which had no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, &amp; was deſpiſed of the Iews, ſo that it was counted a reproach, if a Iewe did talke with a Samaritane, or had any bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines, or any thing to doe with him; this Samaritane I ſay, ſhewed him ſelfe more godly then the Iewes, and not better then the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon ſort, but better then the prieſts and the Leuits, which did teach &amp; exhort to vertue and holines, and which ſhould haue giuen woorthy examples, like lights vpon a hill. So the prieſts of the temple, which deſcended of the holy patriarkes,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:20355:181"/>Abraham, Iſaac, and Iacob, did ſlander our Sauiour Chriſt, who was reuerently vſed of the woman of Canaan, which came of curſed Cham. He found not that faith in Iſrael, which he found among the Canaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites. I feare me it wil fall out, (&amp; I would in this I might be found a lyer,) that in the day of iudgement many publicans, and of the common ſort, ſhall be preferred before vs, which preach the word, and exhort o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnto vertue, and make great boaſt of Religion, ſeeing many of thoſe whom we doe teach, doe farre paſſe vs in life &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation, and may teach vs, if not in words &amp; exhortation, yet in godly works. As the Lord ſaide to many proud Phariſes, that publicanes and ſinners ſhould goe before them, into the kingdom of heauen. Many ſhall come from the Eaſt and from the Weſt, and ſhall ſit downe with Abraham, Iſaac, and Iacob, when as the children of the kingdome ſhall be caſt out into vtter darknes. Which is enough to teach vs, to deſpiſe no man, but alwayes to liue in holy feare and humility. For before God the works of charity and godlines, are more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed, then either learning, wiſedome, or the glorious ſhew of Religion. For God
<pb facs="tcp:20355:182"/>hath not reſpect of the perſons or of high degrees, but God regardeth more the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward affection, and the perfection of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. The Prieſt and the Leuite were of higher degree then the Samaritane, but the Samaritane ſhewed himſelfe the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter man. For the prieſt and the Leuit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſame nation, ſhould haue had compaſſion on the wounded Iewe, but they did nothing leſſe, paſſing by, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding not.</p>
               <p>Heere alſo we learne, how few there be that haue mercy on their poore neighbors, when of three there was but one that had compaſſion. And ſuch are our times, which in ſteede of mercy, exerciſe cruelty towarde our neighbours. Then among three yet there was ſome mercy found, but nowe you ſhall ſcarce finde one among a hundred, which remembreth &amp; releeueth the eſtate of the poore and diſtreſſed, as daily experience ſheweth. Nowe a man may ſee a great company of poore &amp; La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus people, lie at the church dores, &amp; all the company paſſe by, neither is there one among twenty that wil turne his eyes vnto the poore, ſo farve off are they from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting them, eyther in words or deedes.
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:20355:182"/>And moſt lamentable it is, that there be many poore houſholders that are eſhamed to ſhew their diſtreſſe, yet is their eſtate well knowne of the rich &amp; wealthy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors, which can ſcarcely find in their harts to talke of them, or to be ſorry for their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity.

               <p>Thirdly, we are taught by this example, to ſhew charity and mercy, not niggardly, but in alarge and plentifull meaſure, for God regardeth a cheerefull giuer. This Samaritane had not onely compaſſion, but went to him, poured oyle into his wounds, bound them vp, brought him to an Inne, prayed the Hoſt to haue care of him, and left money in his Hoſts hands. Compare this example to the rich man, who would not refreſh poore Lazarus at his gate, yea, Lazarus found more mercy of his dogges then of him, for they licked his ſores. But as the one found fauour with God, ſo the other no doubt feeleth eternall torments. VVhat is a ſlender releefe to him which ſtandeth in neede of great ſuccour, bring him into thy houſe, and ſupply his wants; if thou wilt not bring him into thy houſe, goe to the poore where they are and ſhew thy almes as God hath enriched thee. This
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:20355:183"/>Samaritane was no penny-father, no nig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, his hands were not ſhut, but moſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally and plentifully did he releeue the wounded man. Let this Samaritane be thy example, and be it knowne vnto thee, that whatſoeuer thou be ſloweſt on the poore, thou giueſt into the hand of Chriſt, which will recompence it with aduantage. For many are his bleſſings, which he hath, and may heereafter beſtow vpon vs, in reſpect both of our body &amp; ſoule. Pinch not thy ſelfe therefore, which ſurely thou doeſt, when thou doſt not help the poore.</p>
               <p>By this Samaritane alſo we are taught, not to be ouer-ſquemiſh in beholding the ſores &amp; wounds of the poore, as many too daintily turne their eyes away, &amp; ſtop their noſes. This Samaritane, hee handled the poore mans wounds, and bound them vp. Chriſt humbled himſelfe, and healed eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diſeaſe among the people, and refuſed not their company.</p>
               <p>Fiftly in giuing our almes, we muſt not conſider his Countrey or perſonage, his qualities or deſerts, that thereby we ſhould with-draw our hand from doing good, but onely we muſt remember he or ſhe is our neighbour, as alſo we muſt haue an eye to
<pb facs="tcp:20355:184"/>their great wants &amp; neceſſities. Many are not willing to giue almes, but to their kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, &amp; ſuch as they know, other ſome fall into the examination of the liues of the poore, whether they be of good or euil be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour. This ſheweth mercy not to one of his owne nation, but to an enemy. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraine not therefore thy liberality from thy neighbor in his neceſſity, although he haue ſpoken very badly of thee, although he be thy enemy. Yea, let him be a ſtranger, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou neuer ſaweſt in thy life before, yet co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that he is thy neighbour, &amp; that he is made according to the image &amp; likenes of God, let that be thy looking glaſſe, &amp; help his miſerable eſtate It is the duty of iuſtice, to enquire into other mens faults, but the property of mercy is to haue compaſſion.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all, heereby we are warned, not onley to be inwardly affected, but alſo to put to our helping hand. Many rich peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple will take pitty, but there-with-all they haue many dolaies and diuers excuſes.</p>
               <p>Which now of theſe three thinkeſt thou was neighbour vnto him that fell among the theeues? And he ſaid; He that ſhewed mercy on him. Then ſaid Ieſus vnto him, Goe &amp; doe thou likewiſe.] Now Chriſt
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:20355:184"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to the application of the parable, &amp; to anſwer this learned Doctor. And this is the concluſion of the parable, where our Sauiour reſerueth the wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ightieſt matter to the laſt. Shewing that not onely he is our neighbour, which may doe vs good, but he alſo that ſtandeth in neede of our helpe. Whom we muſt help, not onely in words &amp; paſſionate ſpeeches, but alſo in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble releefe, which is acceptable both before God &amp; man. The more mercifull that any one is, the neerer doth he come to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God. Delay not thy mercy, put ſo acceptable a work in practiſe, be not ſlow, goe &amp; doe thou likewiſe. Titus the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror would ſay, that he loſt a day, when in that day hee had not done one good turne, to ſome man or other.</p>
               <p>Ieſus commended this Doctor, that he had made a right anſwer &amp; a true, mouing him there-with-all, that his life ſhould be like and anſwerable vnto his words, &amp; that he ſhold be willing, rather to be like to the Samaritane, then to the prieſt or the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uite, who as men liuing to the behoofe of themſelues and no more, had little or no regard of any other, but the Samaritane, where by birth and kinde hee was enemie
<pb facs="tcp:20355:185"/>vnto the Iew, in charity and loue became his neighbour.</p>
               <p>All the vniuerſall progeny of mankind, being through the malice of ſathan, ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led out of the cloathing of innocencie, ſore wounded with all kind of vice, caſt a ſide, deſtitute of helpe, halfe dead, and euen at the next dore to deſperation, Ieſus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming downe from heauen, vouchſafed to viſite and ſee them. And to the ende hee might the better helpe them, by taking mans nature on him, he came very neere to man, both ſeeing and being ſeene, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and being heard, feeling, and being felt; and hauing pitty on our extreame di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe, he tooke vpon him our ſinnes, and beare them on his owne body, he did in his own proper perſon ſuffer that we had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued. The ſame Ieſus hath ſeene to the curing of vs, who neuer turned his face from any ſinner, were he neuer ſo vile or abiect. Whereas the proud and diſdain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full prieſt paſſeth by him, euen then giuing vp the ghoſt, whereas the Leuit neglec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth him, bidding God haue mercy vpon him and ſo going foorth on his way as hee had begun, leaſt he ſhould ſuſtaine ſome hinderance or damage in the things of the
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:20355:185"/>world, while hee helpeth his neighbour. Ieſus this Samaritane hath his Hoſts and In-holders, to whom he leauing the earth, and aſcending into heauen, doth commit the wounded man to be wel looked vnto, promiſing a reward in heauen, if through the aboundance of charity, they ſhall haue laied out any thing more, then was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded, for the healing of the pittious body. And by theſe In-holders, are to be vnderſtoode, the Apoſtles, Miniſters, and Preachers, by whoſe painfull preaching, he doth cure and helpe mankind, and gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the ſame from the violence of theeues, into the inner roome of the church, where the wounds of ſinne are healed.</p>
               <p>By the doctrine of the goſpell, our very enemies muſt be loued, and by Chriſt his example, the poore, the ſtrangers, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſſe, and widdow, are to be releeued by our almes and charitable deuotion. For true it is that Chriſt is loued in his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, in whom likewiſe he is offended, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their weake conſciences are offended, and is put to open ſhame of the world, when they be put to ſhame, and is put to death whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they be put to death, &amp; wants releefe, when they are in need and neceſſity.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:20355:186"/>
               <p>The fountaine of mercy is the loue of thy neighbour, for if thou doeſt not affect the party, thy mercy will ſoone grow key colde. And that thou mayeſt take liking to the party, yea, although he be thy ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, if it be no more but for Gods cauſe, and at his requeſt, mark what Chriſt ſaith. If ye loue mee, keepe my commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, whereof this is one, Loue your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, doe good to them that hate you. Kill thy anger and thy wrath, bury thy ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, and tread it vnder thy foote, GOD hath been fauourable vnto thee, doe ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what at his requeſt, doe more for his loue. Heb. 6, 10. God is not vnrighteous, that he will forget your works and labour, that proceedeth of loue. Heb. 13. To doe good, and to deſtribute forgette not, for with ſuch ſacrifices God is pleaſed, 2, Cor. 9, 6, 7. Hee which ſoweth little, ſhall reape little, and he that ſoweth plenteouſly ſhall reape alſo plenteouſly. Let euery man doe according as hee is diſpoſed in heart, not grudgingly, or of neceſſity, for God loueth a cheerefull giuer, 1, Iohn, 3, 17. Who ſo hath this worldes good, and ſeeth his brother haue neede, and ſhutteth vp his compaſſion from him, how dwelleth
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:20355:186"/>the loue of God in him. Tob. 4, 7. Giue almes of thy goods, and turne neuer thy face from any poore man, and then the face of the Lord ſhall not be turned away from thee. Be mercifull after thy power, if thou haſt much giue plenteouſly, if thou haſt little, doe thy diligence gladly to giue of that little. For ſo gathereſt thou thy ſelfe a good reward in the day of neceſſity, Pro. 19, 17. Hee that hath pitty vpon the poore, lendeth vnto the Lorde, and looke what he layeth out (he ſhall looſe nothing) it ſhall be paide him againe. Pſalme, 41. Bleſſed is hee that conſidereth the poore and needy, the Lorde ſhall deliuer him in the time of trouble. The Lorde preſerue him, and keepe him aliue, that hee may be bleſſed vppon earth, and deliuer not thou him into the will of his aduerſaries and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies. The Lorde comfort him when he lyeth ſicke vpon his bed, make thou all his bed in his ſicknes. Gal. 6, 10. While we haue time let vs doe good to all men, and ſpecially to them which are of the houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde of faith. 1, Timo. 6, 17. Charge them which are rich in the world that they be ready to giue, and gladly to deſtribute, laying vp in ſtore for themſelues, a good
<pb facs="tcp:20355:187"/>foundation againſt the time to come, that they may obtaine eternall life.</p>
               <p>In concluſion, gather this leſſon alſo, to ſee the mildnes of our ſauiour Chriſt, how largely, and modeſtly, and delightfully, he aunſwereth and ſatisfieth his enemy, which came to intrap him, that wee may learne with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

He put him on his owne beaſt, ſo hath Chriſt taken vpon his owne body our infirmities. Brought him to an Inne, and made prouiſion for him, Chriſt hath brought vs into the Church, according to that of Saint Paule, Whom he hath choſen, them alſo hath hee called. For thoſe who are not called, are no members of his Church, neither any of his people. The two pence heere named, are the Lawe and the Goſpell, the two Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by the miniſtery wherof, the church is inſtructed &amp; gouerned, &amp; ſo ſhall be to the end of the world. The law doth terrefy, the goſpell doth comfort, and propoſeth Chriſt vnto vs, to be our ſpirituall Phiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, which doth mollifie the wounds of our conſcience, with the oyle of his grace. The Hoſt is euery faithful &amp; painfull Miniſter &amp; preacher, which with conſcience taketh

And if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny trouble &amp; perſecution grow thervpon, let vs refer al to Gods good wil &amp; pleſure, &amp; in all extremities, learne to depend vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Gods prouidence.

And what dangers ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer fall out, God will not then and there forſake thee, but hee will ſtand by thee, as the Phiſitian ſtandeth by the ſicke man, or the Nurſe by the chylde.

               <p>NExt after the notable example of the mercifull Samaritane, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon and contrarietie, the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the vnmercifull ſeruant ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth moſt worthy of our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideration &amp; edification. Euery one ought to forgiue his neighbour that hath offended him, ſo often as he asketh forgiuenes. According to that which elſe-where our Sauiour ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth, Luke. 17.3. Take heede to your ſelues, if thy brother treſpaſſe againſt thee,
<pb facs="tcp:20355:190"/>rebuke him, and if he repent, forgiue him. And though he ſinne againſt thee ſeauen times in a day, and ſeauen times in a day turne againe vnto thee, ſaying; It repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth mee, thou ſhalt forgiue him. As thys parable doth ſhewe, by Gods great pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and by the riches of his mercy, howe ready wee alſo ought to be to forgiue one another. The kingdome of heauen, may be applyed to the Church of God in thys lyfe, the which God doth rule by his word and by his Spirit, and dooth mightily and miraculouſly defend it, from all enemies, priuie hypocrites, open Atheiſts, cruell Tyrants, the deuill, death, ſinne, and all the power of hell. God is the King, &amp; wee are his ſeruants, into whoſe hands hee putteth his gyfts and graces, that we may employ them to his glory, and the benefit of his Church. And in this ſence alſo we are deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters vnto God, becauſe no man can fulfill his law, as hee requireth, but diuers wayes we doe tranſgreſse the ſame.</p>

<pb n="196" facs="tcp:20355:190"/>to vnderſtand, that all of vs ſhall giue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of thoſe things, we haue done in this body, 2. Cor. 5.10. Hebr. 9.27. Rom. 2.6. Iohn. 5.28. Tenne thouſand talents doth ſhewe our infinite debt, and our manifold ſinnes and tranſgreſſions, more then the hayres of our head. And as he whoſe debt is infinite, and beeing farre vnable to pay, hath no other meane to helpe himſelfe, but to fall downe on his knees, and to craue mercie: ſo are wee willed by this parable, that ſeeing we cannot ſatiſ-fie for our ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold offences, wee ſhoulde flie vnto the mercy of God, wherof we haue aſſured &amp; moſt precious promiſes, through the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites of Chriſt our Sauiour. By which one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meane ſatisfaction may be made, &amp; not through our good workes and merrits. Which if they were all ſtretched out to the vtmoſt aduantage that might be, yet can they come nothing neere, if all were ſold, yet payment cannot be made. For in this our corrupt nature, vvho is it that can in the leaſt part thereof, ſatiſ-fie Gods lavv?

<pb facs="tcp:20355:191"/>for ſinne, condemned ſin in the fleſh, that wee might flie to him for our ſatisfaction, and the gracious forgiuenes of our moſt huge debt, after the example of this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt, which acknowledgeth his great vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthines and inſufficiencie, prayeth for mercie, and obtayneth the ſame.</p>
               <p>Peter puts forth this queſtion after the common cuſtome of men, who would be forgiuen, but are loth to forgiue others. The third or 7. time, is not heere limitted, but rather wee are willed neuer to faint, in ſo godly a worke of charitie. Luke. 17.4. and alwaies to frame our ſelues to be mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and mercifully diſpoſed, and that our mindes and harts, ſhould be free &amp; cleere from hatred and malice. This is one ſort of forgiuenes, all deſire of reuenge ſet apart, to loue him that hath offended thee, &amp; to requite an euill turne with a good, althogh wee thinke hardly of him according to his deſert. Many abuſe this doctrine of pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and forgiuenes, caring not what hurt they doe, becauſe we are bound to forgiue. But in this place is meant, that they ſhould be ſorry for theyr fault, confeſſe, and aske forgiuenes. Yet many are ſo ſtubborne, that they will not acknowledge their iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:20355:191"/>but adde now vnto the old, how-beit, in this caſe alſo, wee are commaunded to forgiue. Another kinde of forgiueneſſe it, when we ſo receiue him to mercy that hath offended vs, that we thinke well of him, &amp; are fully perſwaded, that the remembrance of his ſin is forgiuen before God. Which is not onely ſpoken of priuate iniuries, but of all other offences. Therfore he willeth, that they that are fallen, ſhould be releeued by our mercifull endeuours.</p>
               <p>This doctrine is very neceſſary, becauſe by nature we are for the moſt part too au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtere, and ſathan ſets vs on to this cruell ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueritie, that they that cannot be forgiuen, ſhould be driuen to ſadneſſe and deſpaire.

Where-vnto we anſwer, that when ſuch through theyr leuity &amp; inconſtancie, abuſe our patience, yet asking forgiuenes, wee ought to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don them, with this wiſedome, that after, wee take heede of them, and pray to God to mend them, acknowledging theyr ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold weakenes, and beeing ſorry for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> And becauſe it is a thing in a manner vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to fleſh and blood, and moſt hard

This ſimilitude ſtandeth in three compariſons: that is, the Maiſter is compared to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt, a great ſumme to a ſmall debt, and Gods wonderfull and vnſpeakable mercy, to our extreame crueltie. All which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that we farre more grieuouſly offend God, then any brother, or enemy, or mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall man can offend vs.</p>

<pb n="198" facs="tcp:20355:192"/>Chriſt his merrites.</p>
               <p>Then that ſeruaunts Maiſter had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, and looſed him, and forgaue him the debt.] Heere is declared the order and manner of free iuſtification; namelie, that GOD doth freely forgiue vs our ſinnes, and iuſtifie vs, that is, hee reputeth vs as iuſt, and dooth diſcharge vs from the guilt of ſinne, for his Sonnes ſake; and dooth impute vnto vs the righteouſneſſe, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, and deſerts of his Sonne, as though we had perfectly in our perſons, fulfilled the law of God.</p>
               <p>Concerning forgiuenes, it is either Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall, or ciuill. Eccleſiaſticall, when in the publique congregation, by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable tydings of the Goſpell, eyther priuately or generally, we receiue the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of forgiueneſſe of ſinnes. Or vvhen vppon the peculiar and particular confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſome one or more, with publique prayer the Miniſter pronounceth pardon. Ciuill forgiueneſſe is, vvhen among our ſelues, we forgiue one another, not bearing hatred in our harts, for wrongs commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, nor yet thirſting after reuenge.</p>
               <p>Some will ſay we muſt forgiue one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, therefore we muſt not defende our
<pb facs="tcp:20355:193"/>ſelues, nor ſeeke redreſſe. But there is a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt a lawfull defence, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate reuenge, &amp; God hath appointed the Magiſtrate to doe right and equitie. After which ſort a Chriſtian may defende him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, as Paule did, appealing vnto Caeſar. Acts. 15. But priuate reuenge, which is a deſire to hurt, proceeding from a wrathful minde, is heere forbidden. As it is written, Rom. 12. Vengeance is mine, I wil repay ſaith the Lord. And ſutes of law in matters of extremitie, (as that muſt be the laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nothing elſe will preuaile) theſe ſutes of law, I ſay, with a godly mind, may be followed with charitie. Alwaies reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing our ſelues to equitie, &amp; to neighbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, not caring to ſit downe by a little loſſe, ſo that we may recouer our own, in any good and indifferent ſort.</p>
               <p>But heere it was neceſſary to be ſpoken, to preuent an obiection, that ſeeing his maiſter willed him to be ſold, his wife, and children, and all that he had, &amp; payment to be made that ſome gather here-hence, that ſatisfaction may be made for our ſinnes, by our part, and through our endeuours. But the prophet Eſay in his 53. chapter decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth other-wiſe. Therefore all of vs being
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:20355:193"/>debters in this caſe, are inforced to flie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Gods mercy, and to craue the releaſe of this our great debt, which wee can neuer ſatisfie. Neither doth God alwayes ſhewe his ſeueritie at the beginning, that wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing compelled, ſhould ſeek for releaſe, yea, rather by his free mercy offred vnto vs, hee dooth preuent vs in this caſe; but onelie in this parable is declared, that if God ſhould deale with vs in extremetie, what ſhoulde become of vs. As alſo, if he ſhould exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly require of vs, that which wee are indeb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto him, how needfull it were for vs, to fall downe vpon our knees, and to ſue for fauour. For this is the onely hope of helpe, that ſinners haue. Therefore the prophet Dauid being oppreſſed, with the great waight and burden of his ſinnes, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out. pſalme 143. Enter not into iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with thy ſeruaunt, ô Lord, for in my ſight ſhall no man liuing be iuſtified.</p>
               <p>But when the ſeruaunt was departed, he found one of his felowes,<note place="margin">2.

<pb facs="tcp:20355:194"/>ſelfe. And heere is declared, the ſecond matter woorthy of noting in this parable, which is the ingratitude of the worlde to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God and theyr vnmercifull diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition towards theyr neighbour. VVho woulde haue beene to forgetfull, as ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, when the greatnes of his Maiſters benefite was ſo freſh in his remembrance, that his hart could be ſo cruell toward his fellow ſeruaunt.

Many mens minds which otherwiſe might be won, are aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted &amp; eſtranged, through the ouer ſeuere behauiour of the Miniſters: as againe, through theyr negligence and childiſh le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and too milde behauiour, many grow to be too looſe, and giue great offence. As occaſion ſerueth, the miniſters muſt ſhewe themſelues either milde &amp; compaſſionate, or rough and ſeuere. And he that wil per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme his miniſtery in good ſort, as is meet and conuenient, muſt ſecretly knowe and inquire the inclinations and diſpoſitions, the manners and cuſtomes of thoſe, ouer whom hee is ſet. And furthermore, hee ought earneſtly and continually to pray vnto God, that hee woulde grant him the ſpirit of wiſedome &amp; vnderſtanding, that hee woulde giue him fauour among his
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:20355:217"/>people, and incline their harts toward him, and that he would make his admonitions toward them effectuall, and that he would giue good ſucceſſe to his labours. The moſt part doe offende greeuouſly in the maner &amp; circumſtances of reprehending, either for ſuch matters which they doe not well conſider and looke into, or they doe it vnceaſonably, in reſpect of time and place, and company, or without all reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of their perſons and callings, and for themſelues moſt vncharitably, &amp; far from the rule of Chriſtianity. For the amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of others, and peace and quietnes ought to be the ſcope of reprehenſions. Let al things be done honeſtly &amp; in order, to edification, &amp; not to deſtruction. Gods diſhonour muſt rather moue him, then his owne priuate wrongs, neyther muſt his publique miniſtery be troubled by ſuch diſtemperature, let nothing fall from them vnaduiſedly, or that may taſt of their owne diſcontentments. Hauing alwaies regard to Gods cauſe, firſt we muſt conuince the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their ſinne, and the exhort to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Many cry repent and amend, and thunder out the iudgements of God, this in deede ought to be done; but if we doe
<pb facs="tcp:20355:218"/>not firſt, ſhew them, what is amiſſe, it will not be effectuall. For then wil Dauid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe his ſinne, when Nathan ſhall lay the parable cloſe to his conſcience. 2. Sa. 12.13. Then is Nabal ſtroken as dumb as a ſtone, when Abigael ſhall wiſely watch her time, and tell him of his churliſhnes. 1. Sam. 25.36.37. There is a time for all things, &amp; he is wiſe that knowes opportunity, and the Miniſter muſt ſometime waite his time. Ecclus, 31.31. and 6.7.26. and 21.25.26. 2. Tim. 2.24. Then will the Samaritane woman leaue her ſcoffing, when Chriſt ſhall come home to her conſcience. Iohn, 4.18. And then let the Preacher looke to profit by his publique doctrine, and the brother by his priuate counſaile, when firſt they ſhall prooue to their conſciences, that of this or that ſinne they are guilty. Yet this withall they muſt remember, that with the heate of their reprehenſions, they ioyne conſolation and comfort, eſpecially to them that are to be comforted. As the prophets in their prophecies, giue euident example. 2. Sam. 12.13. Da. 4.24. Heb. 6.9. 2. Cor. 7.8.9. &amp; 2.7.</p>
               <p>It is lawfull and neceſſary for the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of God, ſomtime to vſe ſharpe words,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:20355:218"/>if he meaneth to doe any good, eſpeciallie when hee hath to deale with men, whoſe faces are of braſſe, and therefore cannot bluſh, whoſe necks are of iron, &amp; therfore will not bowe, whoſe harts are of flint, and therfore are not eaſily ſoftned, whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences are euen as it were ſeared vp with a hot iron. Howbeit, the Miniſter of God is not alwaies to lay on load, as ſome vndiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly fill their ſermons with inuectiues &amp; exclamations, whereas a litle wiſely ſpoken and in time, in godly and chriſtian zeale, ſhall more preuaile, then all ſuch hot infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations. Somtimes therfore with Paul he is to doubt whether he ſhould come with a rod, or with the ſpirit of meekenes and mildnes. And as he ſhal perceiue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> either more obſtinate or tractable, ſo to make the edge of his reprehenſion blunt or ſharp, as he ſeeth his Still to drop, ſo to quicken or ſlake his fire, and ſo to ſtraine or let downe the ſtring, as that neyther by too much ſtraining, or too much loocing, that ſtring be brought more out of tune then it was at the firſt, and ſo be ſtill left out of tune. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, he is not to handle all a like, but to remember, that all the ſtrings of an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are not a like placed, a like natured,
<pb facs="tcp:20355:219"/>a like ſounded, not all tuned and ſtrained a like, not all out of tune at once, nor all out of tune a like, and that according to their place, greatnes, or ſmalenes, nature, quannty, &amp; quality, euery one muſt more or leſſe be ſtrained. And euen ſo it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men; the Magiſtrate muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued, but with great reuerence and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guler modeſty; the elder ſort muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued, but as fathers, the younger ſort, but as children, and euery one according to his place and calling muſt be dealt with all. 1, Tim. 5, 1, 2.</p>
               <p>Againe, if hee ſhall perceaue two to be fallen downe into one and the ſelfe ſame ſin, he is wiſely to obſerue, how they came downe, and warily to put a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the one and the other. For the one may fall by weakenes, the other of wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, the one of ignorance, the other of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice; the one therfore with lenity, the other with ſeuenty muſt be proceeded againſt. And alwaies he muſt temper his ſpeeches, according to the nature &amp; diſpoſition of the perſons, with whom he hath to deale; and recording to the quality &amp; quantitie of the ſinne againſt which he dealeth. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples heereof we haue not a fewe in the
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:20355:219"/>ſcriptures. Chriſt will not breake the bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed reede, nor queneh the ſmoaking flaxe. Math. 12, 20. Eſay, 42, 3, but the rebels wil he batter in peeces, like a potters veſſell. Pſal. 2, 9. Moſes was the meekeſt man vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the earth, yet none more angry with Aaron then hee, nor more ſeuere againſt idolaters then he. Paul will perſwade A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippa, to become a chriſtian, and wil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uay himſelfe into the bowels of the Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, to win them vnto Chriſt, but hee meaneth to take vp Peter for halting, and to pronounce Elymas the very childe of the deuill.</p>
               <p>Neuertheleſſe, to be reproued iuſtly and ſoundly out of Gods word, and according to their deſert, hath not a like effect in all. As may be ſeene both in the ſtubborne behauiour of Ieroboam, in the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp; of the malicious &amp; wicked Iewes, when Stephen the martir laid their faults before their eyes, Acts, 7, 54.

But if our labour take not effect, according to our wiſh &amp; deſire, let vs vnderſtand, that this chriſtian forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, is a ſweet ſmelling ſauour vnto God. The nature of the wicked dooth heerein liuely ſhewe it ſelfe, in that they become worſe and more ſtubborne. For as doggs being caſt in the water, or tied by the neck or legs barke &amp; bite at them which ſtretch our their handes to helpe them, for they thinke they come to doe them more hurt: So they that are bound with the chaines of wickednes, cannot take in good part the godly endeuours, of them which would ſet them free, but take all in the euill part, and interpret all to the worſt, taking them to be their chiefeſt enemies, and after the faſhion of doggs, they turne back againe, and bark, and bite, and teare.</p>
               <p>Godly &amp; chriſtian ſeuerity, is both pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable &amp; praiſe-worthy, moſt agreeable to the nature of medicine and phiſick.

               <p>Our admonitions &amp; reprehenſions, muſt be tempered with wiſe moderation, leaſt if they be too hard, ſtrait, &amp; too ſeuere, ſom be vtterly caſt down &amp; ouerthrowne.

               <p>Paul ſpeakes to King Agrippa, Acts, 26, 27, as though he would teach vs a way to winne ſinners, euery worde is a motiue, &amp; ſhewes, that he which fiſheth for ſoules, had neede to haue many nettes, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue time, place, and calling, and fitte all words before in his mind, leaſt he looſe his baite.

And that his doctrine, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, admonition, and exhortation, may be of more force, let him remember that he is no priuate but a publique per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and therfore he muſt behaue himſelfe with all grauity. In this vocation, labours are to be endured, greeuous dangers, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, and perſecutions are to be expected, &amp; ſo much the more, by how much more faithfully we ſhall diſcharge our duty. The which things our fleſh doth meruailouſly abhorre: all which notwithſtanding wee are not therefore to refuſe the miniſterie, but with a good mind and courage to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe all dangers that may fall out, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crating our ſelues, goods, and liues, and all that ere we haue vnto God.

<pb n="231" facs="tcp:20355:222"/>without applications, forgetting or at leaſt not vnderſtanding, they doe but little good, when they ſpeake not to the hart. For this is one of the chiefeſt points and parts of the miniſterie, which hath his vſe in teaching, comforting, confuting, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting, and the like. Which ought to be done both publiquely in the congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and alſo priuatly in caſes of ſicknes, and all other afflictions, againſt the tentations of the deuill, eſpecially in the troubles of a diſtreſſed conſcience, when as the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Miniſter, ſhal moſt appeare.</p>

And they that are moſt learned, may take it in good part, to heare thoſe thinges which their children and ſeruants are to be inſtructed in, and which they themſelues had wel-neere forgotten. Our Sauiour
<pb facs="tcp:20355:223"/>ſpake many thinges vnto the people, but yet in ſuch ſort, as they were able to heare it. Mar. 4.33. We haue many things to ſay, ſaith the Apoſtle, Heb. 5.11. which are hard to be vttered, becauſe ye are dull of hearing. 1. Cor. 3.2. I gaue you milke to drinke and not meate for ye were not able to beare it, neither yet now are ye able. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording therfore as the congregation is, ſo ought we to apply our ſelues, not to teach miſteries, where principles are to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, vntill by long cuſtome they haue been throughly exerciſed. Still we ought to regard the capacity of our auditory. 1, Cor. 3.1.</p>
               <p>Vnderſtanding is to be referred to the mind, but wiſedome is the directour of our particuler affaires and daily actions, which teacheth, what, when, and how euery thing is to be done. And they are ſaid to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vviſe, vvho frame not themſelues accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, although they know what is to be done: a great difference there is betwixt contemplation and action, and they that are well learned, are often-times farre to ſeeke heerein. Sometimes he muſt ſhewe himſelfe ſober and grane, that hee be not contemned, ſometimes friendly and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:20355:223"/>that hee be not iudged too arrogant and too proude, ſometimes hee muſt vſe moderation, and ſometimes exhort and entreate thoſe things, which by right may be commaunded and enioyned. But how and when this is to be done, wiſedom is to direct. So muſt they gouerne themſelues in their places, that they be rather loued then feared, or elſe they ſhall bring all to hauocke, where otherwiſe they might doe good; and through their troubleſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour, they may ſtirre vp ſuch ſtormes and tempeſts, which will not eaſily be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed and pacified. And hauing care of ſo many, hee ought to be as the eye in the head, which ouer-vieweth all other parts, and ſeeth alwayes what is moſt fit, neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, and conuenient. The Lorde in his law co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded that they ſhould offer no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing vnto him that was blind, &amp; a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter without wiſdom, is as one that is blind, who often-times runneth into great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credite, through his owne fooliſhnes, &amp; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthroweth his eſtate, which otherwiſe might be of longer continuance. Deut, 1.15. Moſes appointing gouernours, called for men of wiſedome and vnderſtanding, and ſuch whoſe behauiour was well tried.
<pb facs="tcp:20355:224"/>A Gouernour without wiſedome is like a ſhip without a rudder, which is carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with euery wind and tempeſt. In their places Miniſters are gouernours, &amp; what manner of gouernours they ought for to be, we may reade Exo. 18.21. They muſt be choſen with all deliberation and aduiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſuch as be men of courage, and not faint-harted;<note place="margin">Miniſters what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours.</note> men fearing God, and not of looſe behauiour, whoſe lyues may breede more offence, then their doctrine may doe good; dealing truly without corruption, 1. Pet. 5. rather regarding their duty then their commodity, whoſe behauiour ought to be in ſincerity, without all hipocriſie. And hauing theſe qualities, they are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be ſet ouer thouſands, and ouer hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds; without theſe, they are not to be placed ouer fifties, no not ouer tenns. Let him gouerne as well by his example, as by his doctrine, let him be forgetfull of iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and ſlow to anger, conſtant &amp; patient in aduerſity, circumſpect and wary in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity; let him be giuen to doe good vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all, to hurt none of ſet purpoſe, and ſo ſhall he eaſily win their harts &amp; good wils, and make a way to doe much good, in his teaching and gouernment.

But I ſay to you, it ſhall be eaſier for Tirus and Sidon at the day of iudgement, then for you. The diſſolute behauiour of Tirus &amp; Sidon, might haue excuſe through igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, wherein Gods Word was not prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, to call them to repentance; vvho though they wanted Gods word, yet had they the light of nature, and the lavve of theyr conſcience to direct them. But Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>razin and Bethſaida, which heards Gods Word, and yet were neuer the better, ſhall be worthy of greater iudgement. Whom God doth not vouchſafe of mercy, them he doth iuſtly appoynt to deſtruction, and from whom he with-draweth the bleſſing of his Word, them doth he ſuffer to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, Acts. 16.6.7.

<pb n="265" facs="tcp:20355:249"/>the vvorld, through the knowledge of the Lord, &amp; of the Sauior Ieſus Chriſt, are yet intangled againe and ouercome, the latter end is worſe with them then the beginning. For it had beene better for them, not to haue knowne the way of righteouſneſſe, then after they haue knowne it, to turne from the holy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement. pſal. 125. Vnto thoſe that are good and true of hart, the Lord no doubt will doe well. But as for ſuch as turne back vnto their owne wickednes, the Lord ſhal leade them forth with the euill dooers. It was ſaid to the Scribes and Phariſes, who had the interpreting of Gods law, and to deale in Gods af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires. Math. 23. Woe be to you Scribes and Phariſes, hipocrites, for you ſhall receiue the greater condemnation. And let the ſaying of the apoſtle to the Heb. chap. 10.26.27. preuaile, ſufficiently to admoniſh vs. If we ſinne willingly, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that wee haue receaued the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth, there remaineth no more ſacrifice for ſinnes, but a fearefull looking for of iudgement. The Lorde therefore in mercy grant vs his grace, to liue in his feare, &amp; let vs endeuour what
<pb facs="tcp:20355:250"/>we can, to make an end of our ſaluation with feare and trembling. phil. 2.12. and 3.14. And let vs follow hard toward the marke, for the price of the high calling of God in Chriſt Ieſus, and continue ſo vnto the end. For as none ſhal be crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned before the end of their race, ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the day of our death, we may fall away from GOD. Solomon that was perfect in Gods ſeruice, yet toward his latter end, his out-landiſh wiues woone his hart vnto idolatry.</p>
               <p>This ſecond part of the puniſhment of the euill ſeruant, and negligent mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, is aggrauated and made more gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous, by that which is added thereunto, that their portion &amp; wofull inheritance ſhall be in that place, where ſhall be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, but weeping and gnaſhing of teeth, perpetuall ſorrowe without the leaſt taſt of comfort, no not ſo much as the leaſt droppe of colde water ſhall be granted to them, that ſhal be tormented in thoſe flames. Iere. 48.10. Curſed be he that doth the work of the Lord neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently. 1. Cor. 9.16. They that preach the Goſpell haue nothing to reioyce of, in reſpect of merrit &amp; deſert. Luk. 17.9.
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:20355:250"/>10. for neceſſity is laid vpon them. But if they preach not, they muſt looke for a woe. For if they doe it willingly, they haue a rewarde of Gods bountifulnes, but and if they doe it againſt their will, notwithſtanding the diſpenſation is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted vnto them. I would to God they would conſider this, that haue the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt gifts, and yet vſe them leaſt; which are fit inſtruments to glorifie God, and yet make themſelues the vaſſalls of this preſent world, forgetting the Apoſtles earneſt perſwaſion, Ro. 12.1. I beſeech you brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye faſhion not your ſelues, like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this preſent world. 1. Iohn, 2.17. For the worlde paſſeth away, and the luſts thereof, but he that fulfilleth the will of God, abideth for euer. Such hipocrites and looſe-liuers, and alſo careleſſe and forgetfull miniſters, for their ſweet plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, where-with they are drunken in this world, taking ſo deepe a draught of this cuppe of tranſitory fornication, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtranging their harts from God, vnto whom once they had eſpouſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in holy marriage, and giuen their names vnto him, ſhall be puniſhed with
<pb facs="tcp:20355:251"/>intollerable torments. And they that by the dutifull performance of their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and calling, would not waite for their maiſters comming, but gaue them ſelues in the meane time, to all libertie and licentiouſnes, their laughing ſhall be turned into weeping, and their ſongs into gnaſhing of teeth. The worme of their conſcience ſhall neuer die, &amp; they ſhall be vexed with perpetuall greefe, for the neglect of their duty; and they ſhall alwayes weepe and mourne, that they had no better grace. They that behaue themſelues moſt negligentlie, thinke leaſt of all to come to this tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I could wiſh that men would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times looke vnto themſelues, and haue a due conſideration of their waighty charge; and not ſo much to be exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thereunto, through the feare of hell torments, as to be allured with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the vnſpeakable reward of eternall ioyes. As the Apoſtle S. Peter 1. Epiſtle. 5.4. doth moſt comfortably perſwade all miniſters. Feede the flock of God, which dependeth vppon you willingly, and with a ready mind.
